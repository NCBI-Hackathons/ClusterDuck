1,29545258,"BACKGROUND: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown an advantage of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) over multiple daily injections (MDI) in the general type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) population. RCT data on T1DM management in pregnancy remain limited. OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review of both RCTs and non-RCTs evaluating CSII versus MDI in T1DM-complicated pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: Electronic databases were searched for studies comparing CSII with MDI in T1DM-complicated pregnancy. METHODS: A meta-analysis provided point estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Continuous outcomes were reported as weighted mean differences (WMD) or standardized mean differences (SMD), and dichotomous data as relative risk (RR). RESULTS: The search identified 47 studies, including 43 non-RCTs, reporting on 7824 pregnancies. The meta-analysis showed a lower HbA1c level with CSII versus MDI in the first trimester (WMD -0.45%; 95%CI -0.62, -0.27). This difference decreased in subsequent trimesters. Compared to MDI, therapy with CSII resulted in higher gestational weight gain (GWG) (WMD 1.02 kg; 95%CI 0.41, 1.62), and lower daily insulin dose requirements in the first (SMD -0.46; 95%CI -0.68, -0.24) and subsequent trimesters. Moreover, infants from the CSII group were more likely to be large-for-gestational-age (LGA) (RR 1.16; 95%CI 1.07, 1.24) and less likely to be small-for-gestational-age (SGA) (RR 0.66; 95%CI 0.45; 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: In T1DM-complicated pregnancy, CSII compared to MDI therapy resulted in better first trimester glycaemic control; this difference decreased in subsequent trimesters. CSII therapy was associated with lower insulin requirements, higher GWG, and altered risk for infants being LGA and SGA."
2,29542418,"BACKGROUND: Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious complication of diabetes seen commonly in autoimmune Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), however patients with Type 2 diabetes are also at risk. Diabetic ketoacidosis may be precipitated by the catabolic stress of acute illness such as trauma, surgery, or infections. Recent studies have suggested that sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors precipitate DKA in Type 2 diabetes. We present a case series of four patients on SGLT-2 inhibitors who presented with DKA. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed and patients who were admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis in the last one year at our institute were identified. The charts of such patients were reviewed and we were able to identify 4 patients who were admitted with DKA and were on SGLT-2 inhibitors at the time of admission for the management of their diabetes. RESULTS: The age group of the four patients was between 45-65 years. Interestingly all four patients were female. The admission blood glucose levels of these patients ranged from 203 to 400(mg/dl). The pH at the time of admission was in the acidotic range with anion gap ranging from 19 to 24. Two of these four patients had symptoms of a localized infection at the time of admission, which was confirmed by laboratory and radiological evaluation. Three of these patients required management in the intensive care unit. CONCLUSION: Ketoacidosis is a rare but serious side effect of SGLT2 inhibitors. It is being increasingly reported as these drugs are now commonly being prescribed in the primary care setting. Awareness that DKA can occur in the setting of relative euglycemia is critical to recognize this life-threatening complication of diabetes. More research is needed to better understand the underlying pathophysiology and precipitating factors leading to ketoacidosis in SGLT-2 inhibitor treated patients."
3,29540672,"The role of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) in inhibiting immune rejection and prolonging islet allograft survival has been identified in islet allotransplantation. This study aims to explore the role of As2O3 in islet xenotransplantation and the action mechanism. The streptozotocin (STZ) was used in C57BL/6 mice to induce the type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) for xenotransplantation models establishment. Donor islets were isolated by digesting. The flow cytometry (FCM) was used to analyze lymphocyte types. The blood sugar level was detected by using intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT). The serum level of cytokines was determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELIZA). The cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay. The mRNA levels were quantified with qRT-PCR. As2O3 prolonged the survival of the recipient mice but had no influence on body weight. As2O3 protected the function of xenograft in insulin secretion and suppressed immune rejection of recipient. As2O3 inhibited proliferation of T lymphocyte and increased the proportion of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells in recipient mice. As2O3 inhibited activation and promoted clonal anergy of T lymphocyte. As2O3 decreased total number of B cells and reduced partial antibody levels in recipient mice. As2O3 and leflunomide showed a synergistic effect in suppressing islet xenotransplant rejection. As2O3 prolongs islet xenograft survival by inhibiting cellular immune response, and increasing Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells, while decreasing partial antibody levels in serum."
4,29538577,"This study aimed to analyze the scientific literature on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus. This is an integrative review whose inclusion criteria were full-text papers available online in Portuguese, English and Spanish; published and indexed in databases Lilacs, Medline, Adolec, BDENF, in the period 2003-2013 that reflected the theme HRQOL, Type 1 diabetes and adolescents. Twenty-two papers were analyzed, from which the following themes were retrieved: development and validation of tools to measure the HRQOL of diabetic adolescents; HRQOL of adolescents with diabetes; factors affecting the quality of life of adolescents with diabetes and resources used to assist adolescents in diabetes management. The HRQOL of adolescents with diabetes has been a widely studied and disseminated topic in international literature, but has poorly echoed in Brazil. Studies published in international journals in English predominated. Thus, we emphasize the importance of conducting research of this nature in Brazil, since the measurement of HRQOL of diabetic adolescents may help the multidisciplinary team in care planning."
5,29537892,"INTRODUCTION: There is a clear unmet clinical need in people with Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) considering present day insulin therapy. New insulin analogues and novel technologies allowing more tailored insulin administration have improved the quality of life of people with T1DM, but issues like hypoglycemia, weight gain and variability in glucose profiles remain problematic. Areas covered: In this review, the clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability of dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitor, in type 1 diabetes (T1DM) is described based on a review of phase 2 and 3 studies to date. Expert opinion: Dapagliflozin has shown promising results as an adjunct therapy in T1DM, resulting in better glucose control, weight loss and lower blood pressure. No increase in hypoglycemia risk, in particular severe hypoglycemia, was observed, but, in comparison with reports in Type 2 diabetes (T2DM), genital infections were more prevalent. Dapagliflozin use was accompanied with decreases in insulin doses, but, to date, only a low risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) was reported. However, caution is needed when interpreting this data, arising from well controlled clinical trials, with intensive education programs around ketone measurements and DKA prevention. Further studies will need to establish how high the DKA risk is and how to mitigate this in a real-world setting."
6,29537377,"AIM: To compare continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy (CSII) with multiple daily insulin therapy (MDI) on metabolic control in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) over the long term. METHOD: 52 T1DM patients treated with CSII and monitored for at least 1 year prior to and at least five years following CSII were included. 38 age and sex-matched MDI controls with a 5-year follow up were recruited. RESULTS: Mean age of the subjects, duration of diabetes and CSII therapy were 17.0+/-4.8 years, 10.7+/-2.8 years and 7.7+/-1.5 years respectively. Mean HbA1c in the year prior to CSII, during the first year of treatment and after 5 years of CSII were 7.3+/-1% (56 mmol/mol), 7.0+/-0.7% (53 mmol/mol) and 7.8+/-1.3% (62 mmol/mol) respectively. Initial and 5-year mean HbA1C levels of controls were 7.9+/-1.08% and 8.6+/-1.8%. Mean HbA1c values were significantly lower in those receiving CSII therapy throughout follow-up. Basal and total insulin doses were significantly lower in the CSII group at all times. HbA1c was compared between subjects by age (0-5, 6-11 and 12-18 years) with no significant difference between them. CONCLUSION: Although CSII mean HbA1c values exceeded accepted good metabolic control limits after 5 years, CSII produces better HbA1c control at all times and in all age groups compared to MDI."
7,29537213,"BACKGROUND: The objectives were to describe the frequency of clinical presentation at the onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and to estimate the prevalence of T1DM among children and adolescents in the AL-Baha region, Saudi Arabia, aiming for early diagnosis of T1DM. METHODS: The clinical and laboratory data of 471 children and adolescents who presented with T1DM and received medical care at an AL-Baha diabetic center during the period from 2007 to 2016 were retrospectively analyzed based on the records. RESULTS: The prevalence of T1DM in the AL-Baha region was 355 per 100,000 population in participants aged from 0 to 19 years. T1DM was more common among girls than boys (57.5% vs. 42.5%, respectively; p=0.3), and the female/male ratio was 1.36 in favor of girls. Hyperglycemic symptoms were the most frequent symptoms at presentation [59.2% vs. 40.8% with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)], and 37% of them presented with loss of weight. Most of the ketoacidosis was mild to moderate (80.2%), while only 19.8% of children had the severe type and DKA was more common (55.2%) among females. The mean age at diagnosis of T1DM was 8.2+/-3.5 years for all patients, and 8.3+/-3.9 and 8.9+/-3.6 years for boys and girls, respectively (p=0.06). Hyperglycemic symptoms were more common in spring (15.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of type 1 diabetes in the AL-Baha region was 355 per 100,000 population, which is one of the highest reported prevalences in this age group. Hyperglycemic symptoms were the most encountered symptoms at the onset of the presentation of T1DM and this may help in early detection of diabetic symptoms by patients and physicians to avoid the more severe types of presentation."
8,29535944,"Introduction: Dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia are metabolic abnormalities commonly found in young patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and both increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Methods: This cross-sectional study was aimed to evaluate the pattern of dyslipidemia and its relationship with other risk factors in children and adolescents with T1DM. A total of 576 T1DM patients aged 10-18 years who attended Changing Diabetes in Children, a pediatric diabetes clinic in Bangladesh Institute of Research and Rehabilitation for Diabetes, Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders over 1 year period from July 2015 to June 2016 were included in this study. Results: The overall frequency of dyslipidemia was 65%. The high triglyceride, high cholesterol, high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and low high-density lipoprotein were found in 50%, 66%, 75%, and 48%, respectively. Compared to patients without dyslipidemia, patients with dyslipidemia had significantly lower mean body mass index (kg/m(2)) (18.4 [interquartile range; 16.2-21.4] vs. 19.5 [17.3-21.5] (P = 0.005)); significantly higher median fasting blood sugar (12.7 [9.9-15.2] vs. 10.6 [7.9-12.6] (P < 0.0001)) and higher median glycosylated hemoglobin (9.8 [8.4-11.8] vs. 7.9 [9.3-10.5] (P < 0.0001)). Hypertension was significantly higher in dyslipidemic patients (9.4% vs. 2.5% P < 0.002). Conclusion: More than half (65%) of our children and adolescents with T1DM had dyslipidemia, among them high LDL was the most common. These findings emphasize the screening of lipid profile in T1DM children and adolescents."
9,29535943,"Introduction: Diabetic nephropathy is leading cause of morbidity and mortality of type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM). Microalbuminuria is the first clinical sign of nephropathy. Methods: This was a cross-section study with longitudinal evaluation of urinary albumin xcretion in 199 children with type 1 diabetes attending CDiC Clinic in BIRDEM over a period of two years. The aim of the study was to assess the frequency of microalbuminuria and to determine other risk factors. We collected blood and early morning spot urinary sample and analyzed for HbA1c by Clover A1c and urinary microalbumin by a DCA analyzer. Children had urinary microalbumin 30-300 mg/L on at least two occasions were categorized as having persistent microalbuminuria. Demographic and clinical data were recorded including age at onset of diabetes, age during registration, gender and duration of diabetes which were compared between patients without microalbuminuria and with microalbuminuria. Result: Microalbuminuria developed in forty nine children and adolescents (25%). Among them 24% were Type 1, 27% were with Fibrocalculous pancreatic diabetes (FCPD) and 68% were Type 2 diabetes. Median HbA1c was higher 10.8 [9.4-12.4] vs 9.5 [8.0-11.2] (P.006) in adolescents with microalbuminuria. On logistic regression univariate analysis independent predictors of microalbuminuria were older age, systolic blood pressure, BMI SDS and mean HbA1c which remained significant in multivariate analysis as predictors of microalbuminuria. Conclusion: We found high prevalence of microalbuminuria which was associated with higher age, systolic blood pressure, BMI SDS and HbA1c."
10,29038315,"OBJECTIVE: Offspring of pregnancies affected by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at increased risk of the development of type 2 diabetes. However, the extent to which these dysmetabolic traits may be due to offspring and/or maternal adiposity is unknown. We examined body composition and associated cardiometabolic traits in 561 9- to 16-year-old offspring of mothers with GDM and 597 control offspring. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured anthropometric characteristics; puberty status; blood pressure; and fasting glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and lipid levels; and conducted a DEXA scan in a subset of the cohort. Differences in the outcomes between offspring of mothers with GDM and control subjects were examined using linear and logistic regression models. RESULTS: After adjustment for age and sex, offspring of mothers with GDM displayed higher weight, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), systolic blood pressure, and resting heart rate and lower height. Offspring of mothers with GDM had higher total and abdominal fat percentages and lower muscle mass percentages, but these differences disappeared after correction for offspring BMI. The offspring of mothers with GDM displayed higher fasting plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, HOMA-insulin resistance (IR), and plasma triglyceride levels, whereas fasting plasma HDL cholesterol levels were decreased. Female offspring of mothers with GDM had an earlier onset of puberty than control offspring. Offspring of mothers with GDM had significantly higher BMI, WHR, fasting glucose, and HOMA-IR levels after adjustment for maternal prepregnancy BMI, and glucose and HOMA-IR remained elevated in the offspring of mothers with GDM after correction for both maternal and offspring BMIs. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, adolescent offspring of women with GDM show increased adiposity, an adverse cardiometabolic profile, and earlier onset of puberty among girls. Increased fasting glucose and HOMA-IR levels among the offspring of mothers with GDM may be explained by the programming effects of hyperglycemia in pregnancy."
11,28854950,"BACKGROUND: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is often related to severe obesity and type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, few studies, and none in Korea, have examined prevalence of T2DM and other variables in PWS. The aim of this study was to identify the prevalence and associated risk factors for T2DM in Korean patients with PWS. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of the 84 PWS patients aged 10 or over (10.3-35.8 years of age) diagnosed with PWS at Samsung Medical Center from 1994 to 2016. We estimated occurrence of T2DM according to age (10-18 years versus >18 years), body mass index (BMI), genotype, history of growth hormone therapy, homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and the presence of dyslipidemia, hypogonadism, or central precocious puberty. Additionally, we investigated cutoff values of risk factors for development of T2DM. RESULTS: Twenty-nine of a total 211 patients, diagnosed with PWS over the study period, were diagnosed as having T2DM (13.7%, mean age 15.9 +/- 3.6 years). In the >18 years group, obesity, HOMA-IR, and presence of dyslipidemia, hypogonadism, or central precocious puberty were associated with the occurrence of T2DM in univariate analysis. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, only obesity (p = 0.001) and HOMA-IR (p < 0.001) were significant predictive factors for T2DM. Based on the receiver operating a characteristic curve analysis, the cutoff values of HOMA-IR and BMI for predicting T2DM were >2.7 and >28.49 kg/m(2), respectively. Of the 29 patients, seven had >/=1 microvascular complication, with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy in 6 of 7 cases. Advanced age and HOMA-IR were positively correlated with diabetic microvascular complications (p < 0.05, Spearman correlation coefficient 0.393 and 0.434, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of diabetes in Korean PWS was similar to that in previous results. BMI and HOMA-IR were strong predictive factors for the development of T2DM in PWS. We specifically suggest the regular monitoring of glucose homeostasis parameters through a detailed settlement of ethnically specific cutoff values for BMI and HOMA-IR in PWS to prevent progression of T2DM and diabetic microvascular complications."
12,28324110,"Context: Lipodystrophy syndromes are rare disorders of deficient adipose tissue. Metreleptin, a human analog of leptin, improved metabolic abnormalities in mixed cohorts of children and adults with lipodystrophy and low leptin. Objective: Determine effects of metreleptin on diabetes, hyperlipidemia, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), growth, and puberty in pediatric patients with lipodystrophy and low leptin. Design: Prospective, single-arm, open-label studies with continuous enrollment since 2000. Setting: National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland. Patients: Fifty-three patients aged 6 months to <18 years with lipodystrophy, leptin level <8 ng/mL (male patients) or <12 ng/mL (female patients), and >/=1 metabolic abnormality (diabetes, insulin resistance, or hypertriglyceridemia). Intervention: Subcutaneous metreleptin injections (0.04 to 0.19 mg/kg/d). Main Outcome Measures: Change in A1c, lipid, and transaminase levels after a mean +/- standard deviation (SD) of 12 +/- 0.2 months and 61 +/- 39 months. Changes in liver histology, growth, and pubertal development throughout treatment. Results: After 12 months, the A1c level (mean +/- SD) decreased from 8.3% +/- 2.4% to 6.5% +/- 1.8%, and median triglyceride level decreased from 374 mg/dL [geometric mean (25th,75th percentile), 190, 1065] to 189 mg/dL (112, 334; P < 0.0001), despite decreased glucose- and lipid-lowering medications. The median [geometric mean (25th,75th percentile)] alanine aminotransferase level decreased from 73 U/L (45, 126) to 41 U/L (25, 59; P = 0.001), and that of aspartate aminotransferase decreased from 51 U/L (29, 90) to 26 U/L (18, 42; P = 0.0002). These improvements were maintained over long-term treatment. In 17 patients who underwent paired biopsies, the NAFLD activity score (mean +/- SD) decreased from 4.5 +/- 2.0 to 3.4 +/- 2.0 after 3.3 +/- 3.2 years of metreleptin therapy (P = 0.03). There were no clinically significant changes in growth or puberty. Conclusion: Metreleptin lowered A1c and triglyceride levels, and improved biomarkers of NAFLD in pediatric patients with lipodystrophy. These improvements are likely to reduce the lifetime burden of disease."
13,28063503,"OBJECTIVE: The decline in insulin sensitivity (SI) associated with puberty increases the difficulty of achieving glycemic control in adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The aim of this study was to determine whether glutamine supplementation affects blood glucose by enhancing SI in adolescents with T1D. METHODS: Thirteen adolescents with T1D (HbA1C 8.2 +/- 0.1%) were admitted to perform afternoon exercise (four 15-min treadmill/5-min rest cycles of exercise) on two occasions within a 4-wk period. They were randomized to receive a drink containing either glutamine (0.25 g/kg) or placebo before exercise, at bedtime, and early morning in a double-blind, crossover design. Blood glucose was monitored overnight, and a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp was performed the following morning. RESULTS: Blood glucose concentration dropped comparably during exercise on both days. However, the total number of nocturnal hypoglycemic events (17 versus 7, P = 0.045) and the cumulative probability of overnight hypoglycemia (50% versus 33%, P = 0.02) were higher on the glutamine day than on the placebo day. During clamp, glucose infusion rate was not affected by glutamine supplementation (7.7 +/- 1 mg * kg(-1) * min(-1) versus 7.0 +/- 1; glutamine versus placebo; P = 0.4). CONCLUSIONS: Oral glutamine supplementation decreases blood glucose in adolescents with T1D after exercise. Insulin sensitivity, however, was unaltered during the euglycemic clamp. Although the mechanisms involved remain to be elucidated, studies to explore the potential use of glutamine to improve blood glucose control are needed."
14,27998701,"PURPOSE: Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) is proposed as a biomarker of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This study investigated: (1) AMH concentrations in obese adolescents with PCOS versus without PCOS; (2) the relationship of AMH to sex steroid hormones, adiposity, and insulin resistance; and (3) the optimal AMH value and the multivariable prediction model to determine PCOS in obese adolescents. METHODS: AMH levels were measured in 46 obese PCOS girls and 43 obese non-PCOS girls. Sex steroid hormones, clamp-measured insulin sensitivity and secretion, body composition, and abdominal adiposity were evaluated. Logistic regression and receiver-operating characteristic curve analyses were used, and multivariate prediction models were developed to test the utility of AMH for the diagnosis of PCOS. RESULTS: AMH levels were higher in obese PCOS versus non-PCOS girls (8.3 +/- .6 vs. 4.3 +/- .4 ng/mL, p < .0001), of comparable age and puberty. AMH concentrations correlated positively with age in both groups, total and free testosterone in PCOS girls only, abdominal adipose tissue in non-PCOS girls, with no correlation to in vivo insulin sensitivity and secretion in either groups. A multivariate model including AMH (cutoff 6.26 ng/mL, area under the curve .788) together with sex hormone-binding globulin and total testosterone exhibited 93.4% predictive power for diagnosing PCOS. CONCLUSIONS: AMH may be a useful biomarker for the diagnosis of PCOS in obese adolescent girls."
15,27807935,"The worrisome rise in pediatric type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is most prevalent among minority ethnic/racial populations. Typically, T2DM occurs during puberty in high risk obese adolescents with evidence of insulin resistance. Screening for T2DM in obese youth can be a daunting task for pediatricians and differentiating between pediatric T1DM and T2DM in obese youth can be challenging for pediatric endocrinologists. There is very limited data regarding the prevalence of T2DM among youth < 10 years of age. Here we present the case of a 5-year-old Hispanic male diagnosed with T2DM after referral by his pediatrician for abnormal weight gain, acanthosis nigricans and an elevated HbgA1c. He subsequently became symptomatic for diabetes with confirmed hyperglycemia and HbgA1c of 9.7% (83 mmol/mol) at the time of formal diagnosis. Type 1 diabetes autoantibodies (GAD65, Islet, and ZincT8) and monogenic diabetes genetic tests were negative. Due to elevated liver enzymes and baseline HbgA1c, he received basal insulin as his initial therapy. In this paper, we will discuss this case and present an IRB approved retrospective review of the characteristics of the 20 T2DM patients <10 years of age identified to date in our pediatric diabetes center. This review highlights that while uncommon, the diagnosis of T2DM merits consideration even in prepubertal children. This is especially true when working with a high risk population, such as our Hispanic South Texas youth."
16,27682711,"BACKGROUND: Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) is a rare disease with an estimated incidence of 1:40,000 live births. Here, we characterize 11 patients treated at Munich Children's Hospital Schwabing. METHODS: We analyzed data on birth, treatment and laboratory results including genetic testing and evaluated the long-term course with a follow-up visit. RESULTS: All patients had severe, diazoxide-(DZX)-resistant hypoglycemia, beginning immediately after birth. Two patients were treated by medical therapy, eight underwent subtotal pancreatectomy and one had a partial resection. Both patients who had medical therapy still suffer from occasional hypoglycemia. Six patients with subtotal pancreatectomy were affected by mild hypoglycemia. Seventy-five percent of patients who had surgical treatment developed diabetes mellitus (DM) at a median age of 10.5 (8-13) years. In 89% of patients with available genetic testing, mutations of the ABCC8 gene were detected. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of CHI-patients not responding to DZX underwent surgery. After subtotal pancreatectomy, patients typically developed diabetes around early puberty."
17,27333897,"BACKGROUND: Prospective data suggest depressive symptoms worsen insulin resistance and accelerate type 2 diabetes (T2D) onset. PURPOSE: We sought to determine whether reducing depressive symptoms in overweight/obese adolescents at risk for T2D would increase insulin sensitivity and mitigate T2D risk. METHOD: We conducted a parallel-group, randomized controlled trial comparing a 6-week cognitive-behavioral (CB) depression prevention group with a 6-week health education (HE) control group in 119 overweight/obese adolescent girls with mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale [CES-D] >/=16) and T2D family history. Primary outcomes were baseline to post-intervention changes in CES-D and whole body insulin sensitivity index (WBISI), derived from 2-h oral glucose tolerance tests. Outcome changes were compared between groups using ANCOVA, adjusting for respective baseline outcome, puberty, race, facilitator, T2D family history degree, baseline age, adiposity, and adiposity change. Multiple imputation was used for missing data. RESULTS: Depressive symptoms decreased (p < 0.001) in CB and HE from baseline to posttreatment, but did not differ between groups (DeltaCESD = -12 vs. -11, 95 % CI difference = -4 to +1, p = 0.31). Insulin sensitivity was stable (p > 0.29) in CB and HE (DeltaWBISI = 0.1 vs. 0.2, 95 % CI difference = -0.6 to +0.4, p = 0.63). Among all participants, reductions in depressive symptoms were associated with improvements in insulin sensitivity (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Girls at risk for T2D displayed reduced depressive symptoms following 6 weeks of CB or HE. Decreases in depressive symptoms related to improvements in insulin sensitivity. Longer-term follow-up is needed to determine whether either program causes sustained decreases in depressive symptoms and improvements in insulin sensitivity. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: The trial was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01425905)."
18,27179965,"Puberty is a time of considerable metabolic and hormonal change. Notably, puberty is associated with a marked decrease in insulin sensitivity, on par with that seen during pregnancy. In otherwise healthy youth, there is a nadir in insulin sensitivity in mid-puberty, and then it recovers at puberty completion. However, there is evidence that insulin resistance (IR) does not resolve in youth who are obese going into puberty and may result in increased cardiometabolic risk. Little is known about the underlying pathophysiology of IR in puberty, and how it might contribute to increased disease risk (e.g., type 2 diabetes). In this review, we have outlined what is known about the IR in puberty in terms of pattern, potential underlying mechanisms and other mediating factors. We also outline other potentially related metabolic changes that occur during puberty, and effects of underlying insulin resistant states (e.g., obesity) on pubertal changes in insulin sensitivity."
19,27149485,"Early menarche is strongly associated with adulthood obesity; however, the relationship between age at menarche and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Korean women remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the association between early menarche and risk factors for developing CVD during adulthood using a nationwide population database.In total, 12,336 women (weighted n = 17,483,406; weighted age, 45.7 years) who participated in the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2010 to 2013 were included in this study. Participants were scored using the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria for metabolic syndrome. Risk of CVD was estimated using the 10-year Framingham Coronary Heart Disease Risk Point Scale (10-year FRS).Early menarche (</=11 years) was reported in 5.2% (weighted n = 917,493) of subjects. The weighted prevalences of metabolic syndrome and >/=20% 10-year FRS were 23.6% [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 22.7-24.6] and 7.7% (7.1-8.3), respectively. Women with early menarche reported a significantly higher body mass index and waist circumference, along with a higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome than those with later menarche (>/=13 years). Furthermore, the prevalence of women with a >/=10% or >/=20% 10-year FRS was higher in those with early menarche than in other groups after adjusting for age, smoking, education level, and menstruation. Logistic regression analyses controlling for these and other confounding factors revealed odds ratios of 2.29 (95% CI = 1.25-4.19) and 1.78 (0.96-3.30) for >/=10% and >/=20% 10-year FRS in women with early menarche, respectively, compared with those in the latest menarche group (>/=17 years).Taken together, this nationwide study revealed that women with early menarche are at increased risks of metabolic syndrome and CVD. Early menarche may therefore represent an important marker for early preventive interventions."

21,29483906,"About two decades ago, cloning of the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene materialized one of the most important actors on the scene of self-tolerance. Thymic transcription of genes encoding tissue-specific antigens (ts-ags) is activated by AIRE protein and embodies the essence of thymic self-representation. Pathogenic AIRE variants cause the autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1, which is a rare and complex disease that is gaining attention in research on autoimmunity. The animal models of disease, although not identically reproducing the human picture, supply fundamental information on mechanisms and extent of AIRE action: thanks to its multidomain structure, AIRE localizes to chromatin enclosing the target genes, binds to histones, and offers an anchorage to multimolecular complexes involved in initiation and post-initiation events of gene transcription. In addition, AIRE enhances mRNA diversity by favoring alternative mRNA splicing. Once synthesized, ts-ags are presented to, and cause deletion of the self-reactive thymocyte clones. However, AIRE function is not restricted to the activation of gene transcription. AIRE would control presentation and transfer of self-antigens for thymic cellular interplay: such mechanism is aimed at increasing the likelihood of engagement of the thymocytes that carry the corresponding T-cell receptors. Another fundamental role of AIRE in promoting self-tolerance is related to the development of thymocyte anergy, as thymic self-representation shapes at the same time the repertoire of regulatory T cells. Finally, AIRE seems to replicate its action in the secondary lymphoid organs, albeit the cell lineage detaining such property has not been fully characterized. Delineation of AIRE functions adds interesting data to the knowledge of the mechanisms of self-tolerance and introduces exciting perspectives of therapeutic interventions against the related diseases."
22,29377640,"BACKGROUND: Infants of diabetic mothers have been shown in several studies to have an increased frequency of malformations. In previous studies, an increased frequency of several specific malformations has been noted, including anencephaly, bilateral renal agenesis, and double outlet right ventricle. Surveillance, used to identify all malformed infants in a consecutive sample of births, can identify a distinctive pattern of malformations among the affected infants. METHODS: The infants of insulin-dependent, pregestational diabetic mothers were identified in the daily review of the medical records of each newborn infant with a malformation and her/his mother's medical record. Infants of mothers with gestational diabetes were excluded. The frequency of each malformation was compared to that among the malformed infants of nondiabetic mothers. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-three malformed infants of diabetic mothers were identified among the 289,365 births. The most notable malformations were: neural tube defects (anencephaly, 9%), heart defects (transposition of great arteries, 4%), bilateral renal agenesis or dysgenesis (6%), and vertebral anomalies (hemivertebrae, 4%). CONCLUSIONS: There was a recognizable pattern of malformations and characteristics of infants of diabetic mothers, although there was variation in the pattern among affected infants. Some of the malformations in the diabetic embryopathy can be identified in prenatal screening by ultrasound. More important, their occurrence can be reduced significantly by the mother achieving much better control of her diabetes mellitus prior to conception."
23,29344042,"Background: Diabetes is a serious chronic disease during childhood. Because of the chronic nature of the disease, self-care is necessary. Education alone is not effective in providing care. Misunderstanding by the patients regarding diabetes during the training programs render telephone follow-up after training essential. Materials and Methods: This quasi-experimental study with two groups (experimental and control) was conducted in two phases in 2014. The study population consisted of 70 children of 10-18 years of age with type I diabetes (35 patients in the experimental group and 35 in the control group). The participants were randomly selected from the patients referring to the Sedigheh Tahereh Diabetic Research and Treatment Center in Isfahan, Iran. Data were collected using a researcher-made questionnaire on self-care and a glycosylated hemoglobin recording form. The experimental group received 12 weeks of telephone follow-up training by the center, whereas the control group received no follow-up. Results: The results showed that, after intervention, the total mean score of self-care in all aspects of diabetes care for children was significantly higher in the experimental group (p < 0.001). In addition, a statistically significant difference was observed between the experimental and control groups in terms of mean glycosylated hemoglobin after the intervention (p = 0.030). Conclusions: It can be concluded that telephone follow-up by a nurse can improve total self-care and glycosylated hemoglobin in patients with type I diabetes."
24,29329330,"BACKGROUND: Rising prevalence of childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an emerging public health issue. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association of maternal hyperglycemia exposure during pregnancy with obesity and abnormal glucose tolerance in offspring, and the age at occurrence. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for observational studies on obesity and diabetes in offspring of diabetic mothers (gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and T2DM), and those on non-diabetic mothers. We performed fixed effect meta-analysis for all studies except when heterogeneity was detected. The quality of studies was evaluated using the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Nonrandomized Studies (RoBANS). RESULTS: Twenty observational studies were included involving a total of 26,509 children. Offspring of GDM mother had higher BMI z-score in childhood (pooled MD: 0.14, 95%CI: 0.04-0.24, seven studies, 21,691children, low quality of evidence). Offspring of T1DM mothers had higher BMI z-score from prepubertal to adolescent (pooled MD: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.13-0.58, three studies, 844 children, low quality of evidence) compared with control. After adjustment for maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, this association remained in offspring of T1DM, but disappeared in those of GDM mothers. Offspring of GDM mother had higher 2-hour plasma glucose from prepubertal to early adulthood (pooled MD: 0.43 mmol/L, 95% CI: 0.18-0.69, five studies, 890 children), while those of T1DM mothers had higher rate of T2DM in 2-5 years old to early adulthood (pooled odds ratio [OR], 6.10: 95% CI: 1.23-30.37, two studies, 448 children, very low quality of evidence) compared with control. As there was only one study with offspring of T2DM mothers, evidence is sparse. LIMITATIONS: Only observational studies were included, with a few adequately adjusted for covariables. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to maternal hyperglycemia was associated with offspring obesity and abnormal glucose tolerance especially in offspring of T1DM mothers, but the evidence relies on observational studies with low quality of evidence only."
25,29308448,"Context: Multiple consensus statements decree that women with diabetes mellitus should have comparable birth outcomes to women without diabetes mellitus; however, there is a scarcity of contemporary population-based studies on this issue. Objective: To examine temporal trends in obstetric interventions and perinatal outcomes in a population-based cohort of women with type 1, type 2, or gestational diabetes mellitus compared with a control population. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: National hospitalization data (Canada except Quebec) from 2004 to 2015. Patients: Pregnant women with type 1 (n = 7362), type 2 (n = 11,028), and gestational diabetes mellitus (n = 149,780) and women without diabetes mellitus (n = 2,688,231). Main Outcome Measures: Rates of obstetric intervention, maternal morbidity, and neonatal morbidity/mortality. Results: A consistent relationship was generally observed between diabetes mellitus subtype and obstetric outcomes, with women with type 1 diabetes mellitus having the highest rate of intervention and the highest rates of adverse perinatal outcomes followed by women with type 2 diabetes mellitus and women with gestational diabetes mellitus. Rates of severe preeclampsia were 1.2% among women without diabetes mellitus, 2.1% among women with gestational diabetes mellitus, 4.2% among women with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and 7.5% among women with type 1 diabetes mellitus (P < 0.001). The rate of neonatal morbidity ranged from 8.7% in women without diabetes mellitus to 11.0%, 17.4%, and 24.1% in women with gestational, type 2, and type 1 diabetes mellitus, respectively (P < 0.001). Conclusions: In a contemporary obstetric population, women with diabetes mellitus remain at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes compared with women without diabetes mellitus."
26,29298776,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of type 1 diabetes in all age groups in China during 2010-13. DESIGN: Population based, registry study using data from multiple independent sources. SETTING: National registration system in all 505 hospitals providing diabetes care, and communities of patients with diabetes in 13 areas across China, covering more than 133 million person years at risk, approximately 10% of the whole population. PARTICIPANTS: 5018 people of all ages with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes and resident in the study areas from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2013. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of type 1 diabetes per 100 000 person years by age, sex, and study area. Type 1 diabetes was doctor diagnosed and further validated by onsite follow-up. Completeness of case ascertainment was assessed using the capture mark recapture method. RESULTS: 5018 cases of newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes were ascertained: 1239 participants were aged <15 years, 1799 were aged 15-29 years, and 1980 were aged >/=30 years. The proportion of new onset cases in participants aged >/=20 years was 65.3%. The estimated incidence of type 1 diabetes per 100 000 persons years for all ages in China was 1.01 (95% confidence interval 0.18 to 1.84). Incidence per 100 000 persons years by age group was 1.93 (0.83 to 3.03) for 0-14 years, 1.28 (0.45 to 2.11) for 15-29 years, and 0.69 (0.00 to 1.51) for >/=30 years, with a peak in age group 10-14 years. The incidence in under 15s was positively correlated with latitude (r=0.88, P<0.001), although this association was not observed in age groups 15-29 years or >/=30 years. CONCLUSION: Most cases of new onset type 1 diabetes in China occurred among adults. The incidence of type 1 diabetes in Chinese children was among the lowest reported in the study."
27,29297078,"Importance: Early exposure to complex dietary proteins may increase the risk of type 1 diabetes in children with genetic disease susceptibility. There are no intact proteins in extensively hydrolyzed formulas. Objective: To test the hypothesis that weaning to an extensively hydrolyzed formula decreases the cumulative incidence of type 1 diabetes in young children. Design, Setting, and Participants: An international double-blind randomized clinical trial of 2159 infants with human leukocyte antigen-conferred disease susceptibility and a first-degree relative with type 1 diabetes recruited from May 2002 to January 2007 in 78 study centers in 15 countries; 1081 were randomized to be weaned to the extensively hydrolyzed casein formula and 1078 to a conventional formula. The follow-up of the participants ended on February 28, 2017. Interventions: The participants received either a casein hydrolysate or a conventional adapted cow's milk formula supplemented with 20% of the casein hydrolysate. The minimum duration of study formula exposure was 60 days by 6 to 8 months of age. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was type 1 diabetes diagnosed according to World Health Organization criteria. Secondary outcomes included age at diabetes diagnosis and safety (adverse events). Results: Among 2159 newborn infants (1021 female [47.3%]) who were randomized, 1744 (80.8%) completed the trial. The participants were observed for a median of 11.5 years (quartile [Q] 1-Q3, 10.2-12.8). The absolute risk of type 1 diabetes was 8.4% among those randomized to the casein hydrolysate (n = 91) vs 7.6% among those randomized to the conventional formula (n = 82) (difference, 0.8% [95% CI, -1.6% to 3.2%]). The hazard ratio for type 1 diabetes adjusted for human leukocyte antigen risk group, duration of breastfeeding, duration of study formula consumption, sex, and region while treating study center as a random effect was 1.1 (95% CI, 0.8 to 1.5; P = .46). The median age at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes was similar in the 2 groups (6.0 years [Q1-Q3, 3.1-8.9] vs 5.8 years [Q1-Q3, 2.6-9.1]; difference, 0.2 years [95% CI, -0.9 to 1.2]). Upper respiratory infections were the most common adverse event reported (frequency, 0.48 events/year in the hydrolysate group and 0.50 events/year in the control group). Conclusions and Relevance: Among infants at risk for type 1 diabetes, weaning to a hydrolyzed formula compared with a conventional formula did not reduce the cumulative incidence of type 1 diabetes after median follow-up for 11.5 years. These findings do not support a need to revise the dietary recommendations for infants at risk for type 1 diabetes. Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00179777."
28,29233026,"4-Methyl-2-[(2-methylbenzyl) amino]-1,3-thiazole-5-carboxylic acid (bioactive compound (BAC)), a novel thiazole derivative, is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor and free radical scavenging agent. Effects of BAC on hyperglycemia, insulin sensitivity, oxidative stress, and inflammatory mediators were evaluated in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced neonatal models of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) rats where NIDDM was induced in neonatal pups with single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (100 mg/kg). The effect of BAC (10 and 20 mg/kg, p.o.) for 3 weeks was evaluated by the determination of blood glucose, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), HbA1c level, insulin level, insulin sensitivity, and insulin resistance (IR). Furthermore, inflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6) and oxidative stress were estimated in serum and pancreatic tissue, respectively. Significant alteration in the level of blood glucose, OGTT, HbA1c, insulin level, insulin sensitivity, in addition variation in the antioxidant status and inflammatory mediators, and alteration in histoarchitecture of pancreatic tissue confirmed the potential of BAC in STZ-induced neonatal models of NIDDM rats. Pretreatment with BAC restored the level of glucose by decreasing the IR and increasing the insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, BAC balanced the antioxidant status and preserved the inflammatory mediators. Histological studies of pancreatic tissues showed normal architecture after BAC administration to diabetic rats. Altogether, our results suggest that BAC successfully reduces the blood glucose level and possesses antioxidant as well as anti-inflammatory activities. This leads to decreased histological damage in diabetic pancreatic tissues, suggesting the possibility of future diabetes treatments."
29,29115947,"BACKGROUND: While the United States has the largest number of children with type 1 diabetes mellitus, less is known regarding adult-onset disease. The present study utilizes nationwide data to compare the incidence of type 1 diabetes in youth (0-19 years) to that of adults (20-64 years). METHODS: In this longitudinal study, the Clinformatics(R) Data Mart Database was used, which contains information from 61 million commercially insured Americans (years 2001-2015). Incidence rates and exact Poisson 95% confidence intervals were calculated by age group, sex, census division, and year of diagnosis. Changes in rates over time were assessed by negative binomial regression. RESULTS: Overall, there were 32,476 individuals who developed type 1 diabetes in the cohort. The incidence rate was greatest in youth aged 10-14 years (45.5 cases/100,000 person-years); however, because adulthood spans over a longer period than childhood, there was a greater number of new cases in adults than in youth (n = 19,174 adults; n = 13,302 youth). Predominance in males was evident by age 10 and persisted throughout adulthood. The male to female incidence rate ratio was 1.32 (95% CI 1.30-1.35). The incidence rate of type 1 diabetes in youth increased by 1.9% annually from 2001 to 2015 (95% CI 1.1-2.7%; P < 0.001), but there was variation across regions. The greatest increases were in the East South Central (3.8%/year; 95% CI 2.0-5.6%; P < 0.001) and Mountain divisions (3.1%/year; 95% CI 1.6-4.6%; P < 0.001). There were also increases in the East North Central (2.7%/year; P = 0.010), South Atlantic (2.4%/year; P < 0.001), and West North Central divisions (2.4%/year; P < 0.001). In adults, however, the incidence decreased from 2001 to 2015 (-1.3%/year; 95% CI -2.3% to -0.4%; P = 0.007). Greater percentages of cases were diagnosed in January, July, and August for both youth and adults. The number of new cases of type 1 diabetes (ages 0-64 years) in the United States is estimated at 64,000 annually (27,000 cases in youth and 37,000 cases in adults). CONCLUSIONS: There are more new cases of type 1 diabetes occurring annually in the United States than previously recognized. The increase in incidence rates in youth, but not adults, suggests that the precipitating factors of youth-onset disease may differ from those of adult-onset disease."

31,29545258,"BACKGROUND: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown an advantage of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) over multiple daily injections (MDI) in the general type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) population. RCT data on T1DM management in pregnancy remain limited. OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review of both RCTs and non-RCTs evaluating CSII versus MDI in T1DM-complicated pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: Electronic databases were searched for studies comparing CSII with MDI in T1DM-complicated pregnancy. METHODS: A meta-analysis provided point estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Continuous outcomes were reported as weighted mean differences (WMD) or standardized mean differences (SMD), and dichotomous data as relative risk (RR). RESULTS: The search identified 47 studies, including 43 non-RCTs, reporting on 7824 pregnancies. The meta-analysis showed a lower HbA1c level with CSII versus MDI in the first trimester (WMD -0.45%; 95%CI -0.62, -0.27). This difference decreased in subsequent trimesters. Compared to MDI, therapy with CSII resulted in higher gestational weight gain (GWG) (WMD 1.02 kg; 95%CI 0.41, 1.62), and lower daily insulin dose requirements in the first (SMD -0.46; 95%CI -0.68, -0.24) and subsequent trimesters. Moreover, infants from the CSII group were more likely to be large-for-gestational-age (LGA) (RR 1.16; 95%CI 1.07, 1.24) and less likely to be small-for-gestational-age (SGA) (RR 0.66; 95%CI 0.45; 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: In T1DM-complicated pregnancy, CSII compared to MDI therapy resulted in better first trimester glycaemic control; this difference decreased in subsequent trimesters. CSII therapy was associated with lower insulin requirements, higher GWG, and altered risk for infants being LGA and SGA."
32,29542418,"BACKGROUND: Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious complication of diabetes seen commonly in autoimmune Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), however patients with Type 2 diabetes are also at risk. Diabetic ketoacidosis may be precipitated by the catabolic stress of acute illness such as trauma, surgery, or infections. Recent studies have suggested that sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors precipitate DKA in Type 2 diabetes. We present a case series of four patients on SGLT-2 inhibitors who presented with DKA. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed and patients who were admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis in the last one year at our institute were identified. The charts of such patients were reviewed and we were able to identify 4 patients who were admitted with DKA and were on SGLT-2 inhibitors at the time of admission for the management of their diabetes. RESULTS: The age group of the four patients was between 45-65 years. Interestingly all four patients were female. The admission blood glucose levels of these patients ranged from 203 to 400(mg/dl). The pH at the time of admission was in the acidotic range with anion gap ranging from 19 to 24. Two of these four patients had symptoms of a localized infection at the time of admission, which was confirmed by laboratory and radiological evaluation. Three of these patients required management in the intensive care unit. CONCLUSION: Ketoacidosis is a rare but serious side effect of SGLT2 inhibitors. It is being increasingly reported as these drugs are now commonly being prescribed in the primary care setting. Awareness that DKA can occur in the setting of relative euglycemia is critical to recognize this life-threatening complication of diabetes. More research is needed to better understand the underlying pathophysiology and precipitating factors leading to ketoacidosis in SGLT-2 inhibitor treated patients."
33,29540672,"The role of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) in inhibiting immune rejection and prolonging islet allograft survival has been identified in islet allotransplantation. This study aims to explore the role of As2O3 in islet xenotransplantation and the action mechanism. The streptozotocin (STZ) was used in C57BL/6 mice to induce the type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) for xenotransplantation models establishment. Donor islets were isolated by digesting. The flow cytometry (FCM) was used to analyze lymphocyte types. The blood sugar level was detected by using intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT). The serum level of cytokines was determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELIZA). The cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay. The mRNA levels were quantified with qRT-PCR. As2O3 prolonged the survival of the recipient mice but had no influence on body weight. As2O3 protected the function of xenograft in insulin secretion and suppressed immune rejection of recipient. As2O3 inhibited proliferation of T lymphocyte and increased the proportion of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells in recipient mice. As2O3 inhibited activation and promoted clonal anergy of T lymphocyte. As2O3 decreased total number of B cells and reduced partial antibody levels in recipient mice. As2O3 and leflunomide showed a synergistic effect in suppressing islet xenotransplant rejection. As2O3 prolongs islet xenograft survival by inhibiting cellular immune response, and increasing Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells, while decreasing partial antibody levels in serum."
34,29538577,"This study aimed to analyze the scientific literature on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus. This is an integrative review whose inclusion criteria were full-text papers available online in Portuguese, English and Spanish; published and indexed in databases Lilacs, Medline, Adolec, BDENF, in the period 2003-2013 that reflected the theme HRQOL, Type 1 diabetes and adolescents. Twenty-two papers were analyzed, from which the following themes were retrieved: development and validation of tools to measure the HRQOL of diabetic adolescents; HRQOL of adolescents with diabetes; factors affecting the quality of life of adolescents with diabetes and resources used to assist adolescents in diabetes management. The HRQOL of adolescents with diabetes has been a widely studied and disseminated topic in international literature, but has poorly echoed in Brazil. Studies published in international journals in English predominated. Thus, we emphasize the importance of conducting research of this nature in Brazil, since the measurement of HRQOL of diabetic adolescents may help the multidisciplinary team in care planning."
35,29537892,"INTRODUCTION: There is a clear unmet clinical need in people with Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) considering present day insulin therapy. New insulin analogues and novel technologies allowing more tailored insulin administration have improved the quality of life of people with T1DM, but issues like hypoglycemia, weight gain and variability in glucose profiles remain problematic. Areas covered: In this review, the clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability of dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitor, in type 1 diabetes (T1DM) is described based on a review of phase 2 and 3 studies to date. Expert opinion: Dapagliflozin has shown promising results as an adjunct therapy in T1DM, resulting in better glucose control, weight loss and lower blood pressure. No increase in hypoglycemia risk, in particular severe hypoglycemia, was observed, but, in comparison with reports in Type 2 diabetes (T2DM), genital infections were more prevalent. Dapagliflozin use was accompanied with decreases in insulin doses, but, to date, only a low risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) was reported. However, caution is needed when interpreting this data, arising from well controlled clinical trials, with intensive education programs around ketone measurements and DKA prevention. Further studies will need to establish how high the DKA risk is and how to mitigate this in a real-world setting."
36,29537377,"AIM: To compare continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy (CSII) with multiple daily insulin therapy (MDI) on metabolic control in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) over the long term. METHOD: 52 T1DM patients treated with CSII and monitored for at least 1 year prior to and at least five years following CSII were included. 38 age and sex-matched MDI controls with a 5-year follow up were recruited. RESULTS: Mean age of the subjects, duration of diabetes and CSII therapy were 17.0+/-4.8 years, 10.7+/-2.8 years and 7.7+/-1.5 years respectively. Mean HbA1c in the year prior to CSII, during the first year of treatment and after 5 years of CSII were 7.3+/-1% (56 mmol/mol), 7.0+/-0.7% (53 mmol/mol) and 7.8+/-1.3% (62 mmol/mol) respectively. Initial and 5-year mean HbA1C levels of controls were 7.9+/-1.08% and 8.6+/-1.8%. Mean HbA1c values were significantly lower in those receiving CSII therapy throughout follow-up. Basal and total insulin doses were significantly lower in the CSII group at all times. HbA1c was compared between subjects by age (0-5, 6-11 and 12-18 years) with no significant difference between them. CONCLUSION: Although CSII mean HbA1c values exceeded accepted good metabolic control limits after 5 years, CSII produces better HbA1c control at all times and in all age groups compared to MDI."
37,29537213,"BACKGROUND: The objectives were to describe the frequency of clinical presentation at the onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and to estimate the prevalence of T1DM among children and adolescents in the AL-Baha region, Saudi Arabia, aiming for early diagnosis of T1DM. METHODS: The clinical and laboratory data of 471 children and adolescents who presented with T1DM and received medical care at an AL-Baha diabetic center during the period from 2007 to 2016 were retrospectively analyzed based on the records. RESULTS: The prevalence of T1DM in the AL-Baha region was 355 per 100,000 population in participants aged from 0 to 19 years. T1DM was more common among girls than boys (57.5% vs. 42.5%, respectively; p=0.3), and the female/male ratio was 1.36 in favor of girls. Hyperglycemic symptoms were the most frequent symptoms at presentation [59.2% vs. 40.8% with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)], and 37% of them presented with loss of weight. Most of the ketoacidosis was mild to moderate (80.2%), while only 19.8% of children had the severe type and DKA was more common (55.2%) among females. The mean age at diagnosis of T1DM was 8.2+/-3.5 years for all patients, and 8.3+/-3.9 and 8.9+/-3.6 years for boys and girls, respectively (p=0.06). Hyperglycemic symptoms were more common in spring (15.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of type 1 diabetes in the AL-Baha region was 355 per 100,000 population, which is one of the highest reported prevalences in this age group. Hyperglycemic symptoms were the most encountered symptoms at the onset of the presentation of T1DM and this may help in early detection of diabetic symptoms by patients and physicians to avoid the more severe types of presentation."
38,29535944,"Introduction: Dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia are metabolic abnormalities commonly found in young patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and both increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Methods: This cross-sectional study was aimed to evaluate the pattern of dyslipidemia and its relationship with other risk factors in children and adolescents with T1DM. A total of 576 T1DM patients aged 10-18 years who attended Changing Diabetes in Children, a pediatric diabetes clinic in Bangladesh Institute of Research and Rehabilitation for Diabetes, Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders over 1 year period from July 2015 to June 2016 were included in this study. Results: The overall frequency of dyslipidemia was 65%. The high triglyceride, high cholesterol, high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and low high-density lipoprotein were found in 50%, 66%, 75%, and 48%, respectively. Compared to patients without dyslipidemia, patients with dyslipidemia had significantly lower mean body mass index (kg/m(2)) (18.4 [interquartile range; 16.2-21.4] vs. 19.5 [17.3-21.5] (P = 0.005)); significantly higher median fasting blood sugar (12.7 [9.9-15.2] vs. 10.6 [7.9-12.6] (P < 0.0001)) and higher median glycosylated hemoglobin (9.8 [8.4-11.8] vs. 7.9 [9.3-10.5] (P < 0.0001)). Hypertension was significantly higher in dyslipidemic patients (9.4% vs. 2.5% P < 0.002). Conclusion: More than half (65%) of our children and adolescents with T1DM had dyslipidemia, among them high LDL was the most common. These findings emphasize the screening of lipid profile in T1DM children and adolescents."
39,29535943,"Introduction: Diabetic nephropathy is leading cause of morbidity and mortality of type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM). Microalbuminuria is the first clinical sign of nephropathy. Methods: This was a cross-section study with longitudinal evaluation of urinary albumin xcretion in 199 children with type 1 diabetes attending CDiC Clinic in BIRDEM over a period of two years. The aim of the study was to assess the frequency of microalbuminuria and to determine other risk factors. We collected blood and early morning spot urinary sample and analyzed for HbA1c by Clover A1c and urinary microalbumin by a DCA analyzer. Children had urinary microalbumin 30-300 mg/L on at least two occasions were categorized as having persistent microalbuminuria. Demographic and clinical data were recorded including age at onset of diabetes, age during registration, gender and duration of diabetes which were compared between patients without microalbuminuria and with microalbuminuria. Result: Microalbuminuria developed in forty nine children and adolescents (25%). Among them 24% were Type 1, 27% were with Fibrocalculous pancreatic diabetes (FCPD) and 68% were Type 2 diabetes. Median HbA1c was higher 10.8 [9.4-12.4] vs 9.5 [8.0-11.2] (P.006) in adolescents with microalbuminuria. On logistic regression univariate analysis independent predictors of microalbuminuria were older age, systolic blood pressure, BMI SDS and mean HbA1c which remained significant in multivariate analysis as predictors of microalbuminuria. Conclusion: We found high prevalence of microalbuminuria which was associated with higher age, systolic blood pressure, BMI SDS and HbA1c."
40,29547992,"Aims: Plaque erosion is a significant substrate of acute coronary thrombosis. This study sought to determine in vivo predictors of plaque erosion in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Methods and results: A prospective series of 822 STEMI patients underwent pre-intervention optical coherence tomography. Using established diagnostic criteria, 209 had plaque erosion (25.4%) and 564 had plaque rupture (68.6%). Plaque erosion was more frequent in women <50 years when compared with those >/=50 years of age (P = 0.009). There was a similar, but less striking, trend in men (P = 0.011). Patients with plaque erosion were more frequently current smokers but had fewer other coronary risk factors (dyslipidaemia, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus) than those with plaque rupture. There was a preponderance of plaque erosion in the left anterior descending artery (LAD; 61.2%), whereas plaque rupture was more equally distributed in both the LAD (47.0%) and right coronary artery (43.3%). Despite the similar spatial distribution of erosions and ruptures over the lengths of the coronary arteries, plaque erosion occurred more frequently near a bifurcation (P < 0.001). In the multivariable analysis, age <50 years, current smoking, absence of other coronary risk factors, lack of multi-vessel disease, reduced lesion severity, larger vessel size, and nearby bifurcation were significantly associated with plaque erosion. Nearby bifurcation and current smoking were especially notable in men, while age <50 years was most predictive in women. Conclusions: Plaque erosion was a predictable clinical entity distinct from plaque rupture in STEMI patients, and gender-specific role of risk factors in plaque erosion should be considered."
41,29547660,"BACKGROUND: The effects of diabetes mellitus on the differential white blood cell count are not widely studied in the Arab populations. The objective of this cross-sectional, retrospective study is to assess the influence of chronic diabetes mellitus on white blood cell counts, absolute neutrophil (ANC) and lymphocyte counts (ALC) as well as the prevalence of benign ethnic neutropenia among Arabs attending the Dasman Diabetes Institute (DDI) in Kuwait. METHODS AND FINDINGS: 1,580 out of 5,200 patients registered in the DDI database qualified for our study. Age, gender, HbA1c and creatinine levels, estimated glomerular filtration rate as well as average WBC, ANC and ALC levels, presence of diabetes-associated complications and anti-diabetic medications were analyzed. Our results showed the mean value of the WBC was 7.6 +/- 1.93 x 109/L (95% CI: 2.95-17.15). The mean ANC was 4.3 x 109/L (95% CI: 0.97-10.40) and mean ALC was 2.5 x 109/L (95% CI: 0.29-10.80). Neutropenia (ANC: <1.5 x 109/L) was detected in fifteen patients (0.94%). Six patients (0.4%) fulfilled the definition of lymphopenia (ALC < 1 x109/L). Patients with an HbA1c >/= 7% and those taking at least 3 anti-diabetic medications showed higher values for ANC and ALC. Patients with diabetes-associated neuropathy or nephropathy displayed higher mean ANC values. Our study was limited by overrepresentation of patients over 50 years old compared to those under 50 as well as selection bias given its retrospective nature. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that patients with poorly controlled diabetes displayed higher ANC and ALC levels. In addition, patients with DM-associated complications showed higher ANC levels. This finding would suggest that DM exerts a pro-inflammatory influence on differential WBC counts. Our study also showed that the prevalence of benign ethnic neutropenia was lower than previously reported in other studies."
42,29547441,"OBJECTIVE: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are one of the main causes of morbimortality in HIV-infected patients on suppressive antiretroviral therapy. The objective of this work was to evaluate the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and CVDs occurrence in HIV-infected patients. Additionally, the functional consequences of carrying these SNPs were analyzed. METHODS: The association of TLR4 SNPs, Asp299Gly/Thr399Ile with CVDs occurrence was analyzed using multivariate logistic regression models. Clinical, immunological and traditional cardiovascular risk factors were used as covariates. The monocyte phenotype and response were assessed by multiparametric flow cytometry comparing carriers with non-carriers of this SNP. RESULTS: Asp299Gly SNP, assayed in 253 HIV-infected patients, was independently associated with the occurrence of CVDs after adjusting for CD4 T-cell nadir, HCV-coinfection, bacterial pneumonia, diabetes mellitus and traditional cardiovascular risk factors (OR (IC95%)= 3.672 (1.061-12.712), p = 0.04). Carriers of Asp299Gly SNP showed higher percentage of patrolling and intermediate monocytes producing a proinflammatory combination of cytokines compared with non-carriers (p = 0.037 and p = 0.046, respectively). Intermediate monocyte subset levels correlated with soluble IL-6 levels only in carriers (r = 0.89; p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: TLR4 Asp299Gly polymorphism is independently associated with the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases in HIV-infected patients. The proinflammatory profile associated to this variant could be involved in the development of atherosclerotic pathologies."
43,29547392,"Background Severe mental illnesses (SMIs), i.e. major depression, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, are associated with an elevated risk for the development of type-2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disorders. Several factors have been associated with increased cardiometabolic morbidity and mortality in SMI, including lifestyle factors (smoking, inactivity, unhealthy diet), endocrine and immunologic alterations; however, the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully uncovered. It is now well accepted that visceral adipose tissue (VAT) promotes the development of cardiometabolic disorders, at least in part by inflammatory and metabolic functions. Methods This paper reviews studies concerning VAT, with special focus on intra-abdominal and pericardial adipose tissue, in SMI. Results In patients with SMI, several studies have been performed concerning VAT. Most of these studies reported alterations of VAT particularly in patients with major depression and schizophrenia, independent of body weight and body mass index. Some of the studies also reported an increased cardiometabolic risk. Conclusion Patients with SMI are at increased risk of developing cardiometabolic disorders, and display increased amounts of VAT. As studies so far were mainly performed on patients before the onset of cardiometabolic disorders, VAT may serve as a biomarker for patients with SMI to assess cardiometabolic risks beyond established risk scores. Further, interventions aiming at reducing VAT in SMI are highly recommended in long-term multimodal treatment plans."
44,29547061,"OBJECTIVE Resection of metastatic spine tumors can improve patients' quality of life by addressing pain or neurological compromise. However, resections are often complicated by wound dehiscence, infection, instrumentation failures, and the need for reoperation. Moreover, when reoperations are needed, the most common indication is surgical site infection and wound breakdown. In turn, wound reoperations increase morbidity as well as the length and cost of hospitalization. The aim of this study was to examine perioperative risk factors associated with increased rate of wound reoperations after metastatic spine tumor resection. METHODS A retrospective study of patients at a single institution who underwent metastatic spine tumor resection between 2003 and 2013 was conducted. Factors with a p value < 0.200 in a univariate analysis were included in the multivariate model. RESULTS A total of 159 patients were included in this study. Karnofsky Performance Scale score > 70, smoking status, hypertension, thromboembolic events, hyperlipidemia, increasing number of vertebral levels, and posterior approach were included in the multivariate analysis. Thromboembolic events (95% CI 1.19-48.5, p = 0.032) and number of levels involved were independently associated with increased wound reoperation rates in the multivariate model. For each additional spinal level involved, the risk for wound reoperations increased by 21% (95% CI 1.03-1.43, p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS Although wound complications and subsequent reoperations are potential risks for all patients with metastatic spine tumor, due to adjuvant radiotherapy and other medical comorbidities, this study identified patients with thromboembolic events or those requiring a larger incision as being at the highest risk. Measures intended to decrease the occurrence of perioperative venous thromboembolism and to improve wound care, especially for long incisions, may decrease wound-related revision surgeries in this vulnerable group of patients."

46,29547044,"OBJECTIVE: To compare glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) control and medication costs between patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treated with canagliflozin 300 mg (CANA) or a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) in a real-world setting. METHODS: Adults with T2DM newly initiated on CANA or a GLP-1 RA (index date) were identified from IQVIA() Real-World Data Electronic Medical Records U.S. database (March 29, 2012-April 30, 2016). Inverse probability of treatment weighting accounted for differences in baseline characteristics. HbA1c levels at 3-month intervals were compared using generalized estimating equations. Medication costs used wholesale acquisition costs. RESULTS: For both cohorts (CANA: n = 11,435; GLP-1 RA: n = 11,582), HbA1c levels decreased at 3 months postindex and remained lower through 30 months. Absolute changes in mean HbA1c from index to 3 months postindex for CANA and GLP-1 RA were -1.16% and -1.21% (patients with baseline HbA1c >/=7% [53 mmol/mol]); -1.54% and -1.51% (patients with baseline HbA1c >/=8% [64 mmol/mol]); and -2.13% and -1.99% (patients with baseline HbA1c >/=9% [75 mmol/mol]), respectively. Postindex, CANA patients with baseline HbA1c >/=7% had similar HbA1c levels at each interval versus GLP-1 RA patients, except 9 months (mean HbA1c, 7.75% [61 mmol/mol] vs. 7.86% [62 mmol/mol]; P = .0305). CANA patients with baseline HbA1c >/=8% and >/=9% had consistently lower HbA1c numerically versus GLP-1 RA patients and statistically lower HbA1c at 9 (baseline HbA1c >/=8% or >/=9%), 27, and 30 months (baseline HbA1c >/=9%). Continuous 12-month medication cost $3,326 less for CANA versus GLP-1 RA. CONCLUSION: This retrospective study demonstrated a similar evolution of HbA1c levels among CANA and GLP-1 RA patients in a real-world setting. Lower medication costs suggest CANA is economically dominant over GLP-1 RA (similar effectiveness, lower cost).

47,29547014,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with prothrombotic alterations, and postprandial hyperglycemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular complications. We therefore investigated whether a standardized mixed meal alters circulating microparticles (MPs) and their procoagulant activity in DM patients. Patients with DM type 1 (T1DM, n = 11) and type 2 (T2DM; n = 9) were studied before and 90 min after a standardized meal (without premeal insulin). MPs in plasma derived from platelets (PMPs), endothelial cells (EMPs), or monocytes (MMPs) were measured by flow cytometry. MP-induced thrombin generation in plasma was assessed by a calibrated automated thrombogram. In the fasting state, MPs did not differ significantly between T1DM and T2DM. Meal intake increased the following microparticles: PMPs expressing phosphatidylserine (by 55%, on average), P-selectin (by 86%), and tissue factor (TF; by 112%); EMPs expressing E-selectin (by 96%) and MMPs expressing TF (by 164%), with no significant group differences between T1DM and T2DM. There were no increments in EMPs expressing phosphatidylserine or TF. Meal intake increased MP-induced thrombin generation similarly in T1DM and T2DM with increased endogenous thrombin potential (p = 0.02) and peak thrombin (p = 0.03) and shortened time to peak (p = 0.02). Phosphatidylserine inhibition by lactadherin completely abolished MP-induced thrombin generation, while an anti-TF antibody had no effect. In conclusion, meal intake increased several types of circulating MPs in patients with diabetes mellitus. These MPs have a procoagulant potential, which is related to phosphatidylserine expression and negatively charged MP surfaces rather than to TF."
48,29546745,"The Completeness of Revascularization in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD) remains an unanswered question. Despite 20 years of investigation there are still major doubts in this topic, reaching as far as to the lack of a standardized definition. The employment of different definition and the multiplicity of confounding variables that in general favor patients who receive a complete revascularization (CR) are the reason of difficult comparisons between studies. The complexity of coronary anatomy diseases and the clinical features play important role in the revascularization strategy. However the clinical impact of CR is different in particular clinical subsets, such as diabetes, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, ischemic heart failure. The CR is a desirable objective, but it is not mandatory and sometimes a reasonable incomplete revascularization (IR) offers comparable results. Clinical variables, including patient's age, life expectancy, the severity of symptoms at presentation, comorbidities (particularly diabetes mellitus), left ventricular function and myocardial viability, as well as coronary anatomy should be consider in the decision making whether to attempt CR or to follow a reasonable IR strategy, for both PCI and CABG, in patients with multivessel CAD."
49,29546576,"AIMS: Epidemiological studies of the long-term maternal health outcomes of spontaneous miscarriages have been sparse and inconsistent. The objective of our study is to examine the association between spontaneous miscarriages and diabetes among middle-aged and older Chinese women. METHODS: A total of 19,539 women from the Dongfeng-Tongji cohort study who completed a questionnaire and had medical examinations performed on were included in the analysis. History of spontaneous miscarriage was obtained by self-reporting in the first follow-up questionnaire interview. The presence of diabetes was determined by a fasting plasma glucose level, self-reported physician diagnosis and use of antidiabetic medication. A series of multivariate logistic regression models were used to calculate the odds ratios and 95% CI across spontaneous miscarriage categories (0, 1, 2, >/= 3) after adjustment for potential confounding factors. RESULTS: The prevalence rate of diabetes was 18.8% among the participants. In the fully adjusted logistic regression model, women who had 1, 2 or >/= 3 spontaneous miscarriages had 0.86 times (95% CI 0.68, 1.08), 1.30 times (95% CI 0.82, 2.04) and 2.11 times (95% CI 1.08, 4.11) higher risk of diabetes, respectively, compared with women who had no history of spontaneous miscarriage. CONCLUSIONS: There is an increased risk of diabetes among women with a history of a higher number of spontaneous miscarriages. History of multiple spontaneous miscarriages should be taken into consideration when assessing the risk of diabetes."

52,29545258,"BACKGROUND: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown an advantage of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) over multiple daily injections (MDI) in the general type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) population. RCT data on T1DM management in pregnancy remain limited. OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review of both RCTs and non-RCTs evaluating CSII versus MDI in T1DM-complicated pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: Electronic databases were searched for studies comparing CSII with MDI in T1DM-complicated pregnancy. METHODS: A meta-analysis provided point estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Continuous outcomes were reported as weighted mean differences (WMD) or standardized mean differences (SMD), and dichotomous data as relative risk (RR). RESULTS: The search identified 47 studies, including 43 non-RCTs, reporting on 7824 pregnancies. The meta-analysis showed a lower HbA1c level with CSII versus MDI in the first trimester (WMD -0.45%; 95%CI -0.62, -0.27). This difference decreased in subsequent trimesters. Compared to MDI, therapy with CSII resulted in higher gestational weight gain (GWG) (WMD 1.02 kg; 95%CI 0.41, 1.62), and lower daily insulin dose requirements in the first (SMD -0.46; 95%CI -0.68, -0.24) and subsequent trimesters. Moreover, infants from the CSII group were more likely to be large-for-gestational-age (LGA) (RR 1.16; 95%CI 1.07, 1.24) and less likely to be small-for-gestational-age (SGA) (RR 0.66; 95%CI 0.45; 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: In T1DM-complicated pregnancy, CSII compared to MDI therapy resulted in better first trimester glycaemic control; this difference decreased in subsequent trimesters. CSII therapy was associated with lower insulin requirements, higher GWG, and altered risk for infants being LGA and SGA."
53,29545162,"Birth weight (BW) is inversely associated with diabetes and liver function in Mendelian Randomization studies. Observationally, lower BW is usually also associated with poorer liver function. However, these studies could be confounded by socioeconomic position. Here we assessed if BW is associated with liver function in a unique population with little socio-economic patterning of BW, using both instrumental variable and an observational analysis. We used instrumental variable analysis (IVA) to assess the association of BW with liver function (alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin, and albumin) at ~17years with twin status as an instrumental variable in the prospective population-representative ""Children of 1997"" birth cohort (n=8327). We also conducted an observational analysis adjusted for sex, maternal age, maternal migrant status, smoking and parental socio-economic position. A generalized linear model with gamma family was used for ALT, ALP, and bilirubin because they are not normally distributed. Using IVA, BW was not associated with ALT, ALP or bilirubin, but was possibly negatively associated with albumin (-1.12g/L, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.08 to -0.16). Observationally, BW was negatively associated with ALT (-1.23IU/L, 95% CI -2.16 to -0.30), ALP (-1.72IU/L, 95% CI -3.43 to -0.01) and higher albumin (-0.23g/L, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.06). Poor liver function may be a pathway by which the risks of lower BW are actuated. This insight might help identify post-natal targets of intervention to mitigate the adverse health effects of lower birth weight."
54,29545111,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the value of the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level for simplifying the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) diagnostic algorithm of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in a South Asian population. METHODS: In 6,520 pregnant women undergoing universal screening with the 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), the area under receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the overall FPG performance to detect GDM (IADPSG criteria). Specifically, 2 different FPG thresholds of the OGTT were used to rule in and rule out GDM so as to decrease the need for the cumbersome OGTT. RESULTS: GDM was present in 1,193 (18.3%) women. The FPG 1) area under receiver operating characteristic curve (95% CI) was 0.909 (0.898 to 0.920); 2) threshold of >/=5.1 mmol/L independently could rule in GDM in 708 (10.9%) women (100% specificity); 3) threshold of <4.3 mmol/L independently could rule out GDM in an additional 2,389 (36.6%) women (95.6% sensitivity). CONCLUSIONS: By circumventing nearly one half the OGTTs, an initial FPG can simplify the onerous GDM diagnostic IADPSG algorithm in this population parochially and in countries with large South Asian immigrant populations-without compromising medical care."
55,29544538,"OBJECTIVES: Pathophysiological similarity exists between gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus with common genetic origin. Genetic liability for GDM in our population is still not researched. The goal was to reveal the genotypic and allele frequency differences of 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) namely, CDKAL1 (rs7754840) and CDKN2A/2B (rs10811661) between GDM pregnancies and normal pregnancies. We assessed them by real time polymerase chain reaction using Taqman((R)) allelic discrimination assays. We included 47 GDM pregnant subjects and 51 normal glucose tolerance (NGT) pregnant women as controls. RESULTS: The genotype frequencies in the GDM group and the NGT group of rs7754840-GG/GC/CC were 6.4/15.7% (3/8), 55.3/45.1% (26/23) and 38.3/39.2% (18/20) respectively. Also, those of rs10811661-CC/CT/TT were 74.5/14.9/4.3% (38/7/2) and 80.9/19.6/5.9% (38/10/3) respectively. The allele frequencies in the GDM group and the NGT group of C/G and T/C were 66/34% (62/32), 61.8/38.2% (63/39) and 11.7/88.3% (11/83), 15.7/84.3% (16/86) respectively. There were no statistical differences between the two groups in allele frequencies and genotype frequencies (all P > 0.05). Non-significant association was seen in the two SNPs of CDKAL1 and CDKN2A/B genes with GDM. Further studies are essential to validate data."
56,29543341,"In this review, we aim to summarize knowledge about gestational diabetes (GDM) after delivery; with special focus on the potential of preventing Type 2 diabetes in a family context. The review expands on the key messages from a symposium held in Copenhagen in May 2017 and highlights avenues for future research. A narrative review of the symposium presentations and related literature is given. GDM is associated with increased short- and long-term adverse outcomes including Type 2 diabetes for both mother and offspring. Interestingly, women's partners are also at higher risk of Type 2 diabetes. Thus, although GDM is diagnosed in pregnant women, the implications seem to affect the whole family. Structured lifestyle intervention can prevent or delay the onset of Type 2 diabetes. In this review, we show how numerous challenges are present in the target group, when such interventions are sought and implemented in real-world settings. Although interlinked and interacting, barriers to maintaining a healthy lifestyle post-partum can be grouped into those pertaining to diabetes beliefs, the family context and the healthcare system. Health literacy level and perceptions of health and disease risk may modify these barriers. There is a need to identify effective approaches to health promotion and health service delivery for women with prior GDM and their families. Future efforts may benefit from involving the target group in the development and execution of such initiatives as one way of ensuring that approaches are tailored to the needs of individual women and their families.

The effect of maternal psoriasis and its severity on the risk of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes was examined. A cross-national population-based cohort study was performed using prospectively collected data from Denmark and Sweden. Singleton births in women with psoriasis were identified in the national health registers between April 2007 and December 2012 and classified according to disease severity. Lifestyle factors, co-morbidity, pregnancy and birth outcomes were evaluated. A total of 8,097 births were identified in 6,103 women with psoriasis and 964 births in 753 women with psoriatic arthritis. Increased risk of gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, elective and emergency caesarean delivery was found in women with psoriasis. The risks were higher for women with severe psoriasis, who also had an increased risk of pre-term birth and low birth weight. Pre-conception counselling to improve maternal, pregnancy and birth outcome is encouraged."
58,29542249,"AIMS/INTRODUCTION: To explore the relationship between plasma iron levels and gestational diabetes mellitus, as well as its impact on macrosomia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively compared ferritin level and other Characteristics between GDM gravidas and no-GDM gravidas. The correlation between the levels of plasma ferritin and glucose, Haemoglobin was explored. Meanwhile, we assessed the risk factors of macrosomia outcome. Furthermore, we explored the relationship between ferritin level and the incidence of macrosomia outcome. RESULTS: A total of 793 gravidas were enrolled in this study, of which, 92 gravidas had GDM, and 701 pregnant women were healthy. Meanwhile, 51 gravidas gave birth with macrosomia, another 742 women had normal infants. Compared with non-GDM women, gravidas with GDM were older, with higher levels of pre-pregnant BMI, plasma ferritin, fasting plasma glucose, 1h-postprandial glucose, 2h-PG and haemoglobin. In addition, our results revealed the significant positive correlation between the levels of ferritin and FPG when ferritin level was more than 70 ng/ml. Our results also showed pre-pregnant overweight or obesity, high concentration of ferritin, as well as abnormal levels of FPG, 1h-PG and 2h-PG were the risk links with macrosomia outcome. Furthermore, as the level of ferritin increased, so was the incidence of macrosomia outcome increased. CONCLUSIONS: The current study provides evidence that gravidas with high level of ferritin may be prone to GDM. Besides, high level of ferritin may be an independent risk factor for macrosomia outcome. Therefore, the negative effect of iron supplementation in non-anemia pregnant women may be noteworthy.

59,29541163,"Aims: To evaluate the utility of glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) alone and in combination with haematocrit (HCT) for screening gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) between 12-16 gestational weeks. Methods: This prospective study was carried out in the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Hospital of Fudan University from November 2014 to February 2015. In total, 690 pregnant women between 20 and 35 years old were included in this study. All subjects received a routine blood examination for HbA1c and HCT at 12-16 gestational weeks (gw) and a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test at 24-28 gw. Threshold values for the diagnosis of GDM were a plasma glucose concentration of 5.1 mmol/L after fasting, 10.0 mmol/L at 60 min, and 8.5 mmol/L at 120 min. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of HbA1c with or without HCT. Results: One hundred seven women were diagnosis with GDM at 24-28 gw. An HbA1c cutoff value < 4.55% at 12-16 gw showed adequate sensitivity to exclude GDM (85.0%) but low specificity (17.3%), while an HbA1c cutoff value >/= 5.25% presented adequate specificity (96.6%) but low sensitivity (13.3%) in diagnosing GDM. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for HbA1c (12-16 gw) detection of GDM was 0.563 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.625). When combined HbA1c with HCT ( > 38.8%) for the screening of GDM, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.604 (95% [CI] 0.509, 0.701). Conclusions: Whether the adoption of HbA1c as a screening test for GDM would benefit pregnant women remains to be determined. However, combining HbA1c with HCT for the screening of GDM may be a useful tool to predict GDM."
60,29510678,"BACKGROUND: There is scarcity of information on the clinical features and genetics of glucokinase-maturity-onset diabetes of the young (GCK-MODY) in China. The aim of the study was to investigate the clinical and molecular characteristics of Chinese children with GCK-MODY. METHODS: Eleven children with asymptomatic hyperglycemia and clinically suspected GCK-MODY were identified from the database of children with diabetes in the biggest children's hospital in South China. Clinical data were obtained from medical records. Blood was collected from the patients and their parents for glucokinase (GCK) gene analysis. Parents without diabetes were tested for fasting glucose and HbA1c. Clinical information and blood for GCK gene analysis were obtained from grandparents with diabetes. GCK gene mutational analysis was performed by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. Patients without a GCK gene mutation were screened by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology for other MODY genes. RESULTS: Nine children tested positive for GCK gene mutations while two were negative. The nine GCK-MODY patients were from unrelated families, aged 1 month to 9 years and 1 month at first detection of hyperglycaemia. Fasting glucose was elevated (6.1-8.5 mmol/L), HbA1c 5.2-6.7% (33.3-49.7 mmol/mol), both remained stable on follow-up over 9 months to 5 years. Five detected mutations had been previously reported: p.Val182Met, c.679 + 1G > A, p.Gly295Ser, p.Arg191Gln and p.Met41Thr. Four mutations were novel: c.483 + 2 T > A, p.Ser151del, p.Met57GlyfsX29 and p.Val374_Ala377del. No mutations were identified in the other two patients, who were also tested by NGS. CONCLUSIONS: GCK gene mutations are detected in Chinese children and their family members with typical clinical features of GCK-MODY. Four novel mutations are detected."
61,29491316,"Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is an autosomal dominant form of early onset diabetes. The hepatocyte nuclear factor-1-beta (HNF1B) gene is responsible for MODY type 5 (MODY5) with distinctive clinical features, including pancreatic atrophy and renal disease. We herein report a Japanese case of young-onset diabetes with typical phenotypes of MODY5 and a novel heterozygous missense mutation (p.L145Q) in the HNF1B gene. The mutation was located in the POU-specific domain, and the amino acid residue L145 was highly conserved among species. It is strongly suggested that this mutation explains the phenotypes of MODY5."
62,29486427,"In diabetes, pharmacogenetics can be used both to identify patient subgroups who will have most benefit and/or least harm from a particularly treatment, and to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms of drug action and disease aetiology. There is increasing evidence that genetic variation alters response to diabetes treatments-both in terms of glycaemic response and side effects. This can be seen with dramatic impact on clinical care, in patients with genetic forms of diabetes such as Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young caused by HNF1A mutations, and Neonatal diabetes due to activating mutations in ABCC8 or KCNJ11. Beyond monogenic diabetes, pharmacogenetic variants have yet to impact on clinical practice, yet the effect sizes (e.g. for metformin intolerance and OCT1 variants; or for metformin action and SLC2A2 variants) are potentially of clinical utility, especially if the genotype is already known at the point of prescribing. Over the next few years, increasing cohort sizes and linkage at scale to electronic medical records will provide considerable potential for stratification and novel target identification in diabetes."
63,29473506,"Today, there are more than 32 million patients with diabetes in the Middle East (ME), the number is expected to double by 2040. In contrast to Europe and North America and despite the high prevalence of diabetes in MENA, epidemiological data about incident and types of diabetes in the region is very limited. Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a subtype of monogenic diabetes representing 2-5% of all diabetes patients. The disease is autosomal dominant mode of inheritance characterized by beta-cell malfunction below the age of 35. To date, there are 15 different MODY forms that have been identified; each has a distinct genetic etiology. It is very common that MODY is misdiagnosed between with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Hence, accurate genetic diagnosis is crucial to individualize the treatment and to improve glycaemia control. New technologies such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) offer an excellent alternative to screen and identify causative MODY mutations. In this review, we summarize the main clinical and genetic characteristics for each MODY form. In addition, we shed light on MODY studies that have been executed in the ME region."
64,29458357,"Adult-onset, or type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has a complex genetic architecture, from hundreds of genes with low penetrance, common susceptibility variants (e.g., TCF7L2), to a set of more than ten genes that, when mutated, can cause a single-gene or Mendelian form of T2DM (e.g., GCK). It is a clinical challenge to identify patients with the uncommon (2-3%) form of T2DM, typically classified as maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Bansal et al. (BMC Med 15:213, 2017) used a gene panel test approach to test patients with diabetes for single-gene causes of MODY. They found that nearly 2% of younger patients had pathogenic variants in one of seven genes. These data confirm prior studies showing that Mendelian or single-gene MODY can masquerade as garden variety T2DM. The implications of these results for wider general medicine and the future implementation of clinical genome sequencing are discussed.Please see related article: https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-017-0977-3."
65,29439679,"BACKGROUND: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is an early-onset, autosomal dominant form of non-insulin dependent diabetes. Genetic diagnosis of MODY can transform patient management. Earlier data on the genetic predisposition to MODY have come primarily from familial studies in populations of European origin. METHODS: In this study, we carried out a comprehensive genomic analysis of 289 individuals from India that included 152 clinically diagnosed MODY cases to identify variants in known MODY genes. Further, we have analyzed exome data to identify putative MODY relevant variants in genes previously not implicated in MODY. Functional validation of MODY relevant variants was also performed. RESULTS: We found MODY 3 (HNF1A; 7.2%) to be most frequently mutated followed by MODY 12 (ABCC8; 3.3%). They together account for ~ 11% of the cases. In addition to known MODY genes, we report the identification of variants in RFX6, WFS1, AKT2, NKX6-1 that may contribute to development of MODY. Functional assessment of the NKX6-1 variants showed that they are functionally impaired. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed HNF1A and ABCC8 to be the most frequently mutated MODY genes in south India. Further we provide evidence for additional MODY relevant genes, such as NKX6-1, and these require further validation."
66,29429476,"Maturity onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3) is the most prevalent type of monogenetic diabetes. Treatment guidelines differ from both Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes. First-line treatment is a long-acting sulphonylurea, which lowers the plasma glucose level effectively, however with the risk of hypoglycaemia. When hypoglycaemia is a problem, short-acting sulphonylureas, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors may be used as alternatives. Metformin, glitazones and sodium glucose transporter 2-inhibitors have only limited applicability in MODY3. Further research needs to evaluate combinational therapy."
67,29424410,"Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) refers to a heterogeneous group of monogenic diabetes. Unlike other types of MODY characterized by genetic defects in transcription factors, MODY 2 is triggered by metabolic alterations caused by mutations of glucokinase (GCK), the first enzyme of the glycolytic pathway. We report a three-generation Chilean family with multiple cases affected with this disease. The index case is a patient who presented severe neonatal hyperglycemia (831 mg/dl, without ketosis) requiring continuous infusion of insulin, which was suspended after 48 hours with normalization of blood glucose. Subsequently, continuous glucose monitoring at 4 months of age revealed 47% of tissue glucose levels above 140 mg/dl, with fasting glucose levels between 120 and 166 mg/dl. The genetic analysis revealed a previously reported mutation in heterozygous state of the GCK gene (c.148C>T; p.His50Tyr). This mutation was also identified in more than one affected relative in the last two generations, with a transmission pattern suggestive of dominant inheritance. GCK gene sequencing led to a correct molecular diagnosis of MODY 2 while bioinformatic analysis indicated the possible molecular causes of the enzyme dysfunction. The knowledge of the molecular diagnosis allowed an adequate medical treatment for this disease."
68,29423653,"Complex diseases are frequently modeled as following an additive model that excludes both intra- and inter-locus interaction, while at the same time reports on non-additive biological structures are ample, prominently featuring numerous metabolic and signaling pathways. Using extensive forward population simulations, we explored the impact of three basic pathway motifs on the relationship between epidemiological parameters, including disease prevalence, relative risk, sibling recurrence risk as well as causal variant number and allele frequency. We found that some but not all pathway motifs can shift the relationships between these parameters in comparison to the classical additive liability threshold model. The strongest deviations were observed with linear, cascade-like motifs that form an integral part of many reported pathways. We also modeled maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) as a combination of different basic pathway motifs and observed a good concordance in epidemiological parameter values between our simulated data under this model and those reported in the literature. Given the widespread nature of pathways, including those in the etiology of human diseases, our results re-emphasize the need for non-additive interaction modeling of genetic variants to become an additional standard approach in analyzing human genetic data."
69,29417725,"BACKGROUND: To assess the utility of whole-exome sequencing (WES) for mutation detection in maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI). MODY and CHI are the two commonest monogenic disorders of glucose-regulated insulin secretion in childhood, with 13 causative genes known for MODY and 10 causative genes identified for CHI. The large number of potential genes makes comprehensive screening using traditional methods expensive and time-consuming. METHODS: Ten subjects with MODY and five with CHI with known mutations underwent WES using two different exome capture kits (Nimblegen SeqCap EZ Human v3.0 Exome Enrichment Kit, Nextera Rapid Capture Exome Kit). Analysis was blinded to previously identified mutations, and included assessment for large deletions. The target capture of five exome capture technologies was also analyzed using sequencing data from >2800 unrelated samples. RESULTS: Four of five MODY mutations were identified using Nimblegen (including a large deletion in HNF1B). Although targeted, one mutation (in INS) had insufficient coverage for detection. Eleven of eleven mutations (six MODY, five CHI) were identified using Nextera Rapid (including the previously missed mutation). On reconciliation, all mutations concorded with previous data and no additional variants in MODY genes were detected. There were marked differences in the performance of the capture technologies. CONCLUSIONS: WES can be useful for screening for MODY/CHI mutations, detecting both point mutations and large deletions. However, capture technologies require careful selection."
70,29547392,"Background Severe mental illnesses (SMIs), i.e. major depression, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, are associated with an elevated risk for the development of type-2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disorders. Several factors have been associated with increased cardiometabolic morbidity and mortality in SMI, including lifestyle factors (smoking, inactivity, unhealthy diet), endocrine and immunologic alterations; however, the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully uncovered. It is now well accepted that visceral adipose tissue (VAT) promotes the development of cardiometabolic disorders, at least in part by inflammatory and metabolic functions. Methods This paper reviews studies concerning VAT, with special focus on intra-abdominal and pericardial adipose tissue, in SMI. Results In patients with SMI, several studies have been performed concerning VAT. Most of these studies reported alterations of VAT particularly in patients with major depression and schizophrenia, independent of body weight and body mass index. Some of the studies also reported an increased cardiometabolic risk. Conclusion Patients with SMI are at increased risk of developing cardiometabolic disorders, and display increased amounts of VAT. As studies so far were mainly performed on patients before the onset of cardiometabolic disorders, VAT may serve as a biomarker for patients with SMI to assess cardiometabolic risks beyond established risk scores. Further, interventions aiming at reducing VAT in SMI are highly recommended in long-term multimodal treatment plans."

72,29547044,"OBJECTIVE: To compare glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) control and medication costs between patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treated with canagliflozin 300 mg (CANA) or a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) in a real-world setting. METHODS: Adults with T2DM newly initiated on CANA or a GLP-1 RA (index date) were identified from IQVIA() Real-World Data Electronic Medical Records U.S. database (March 29, 2012-April 30, 2016). Inverse probability of treatment weighting accounted for differences in baseline characteristics. HbA1c levels at 3-month intervals were compared using generalized estimating equations. Medication costs used wholesale acquisition costs. RESULTS: For both cohorts (CANA: n = 11,435; GLP-1 RA: n = 11,582), HbA1c levels decreased at 3 months postindex and remained lower through 30 months. Absolute changes in mean HbA1c from index to 3 months postindex for CANA and GLP-1 RA were -1.16% and -1.21% (patients with baseline HbA1c >/=7% [53 mmol/mol]); -1.54% and -1.51% (patients with baseline HbA1c >/=8% [64 mmol/mol]); and -2.13% and -1.99% (patients with baseline HbA1c >/=9% [75 mmol/mol]), respectively. Postindex, CANA patients with baseline HbA1c >/=7% had similar HbA1c levels at each interval versus GLP-1 RA patients, except 9 months (mean HbA1c, 7.75% [61 mmol/mol] vs. 7.86% [62 mmol/mol]; P = .0305). CANA patients with baseline HbA1c >/=8% and >/=9% had consistently lower HbA1c numerically versus GLP-1 RA patients and statistically lower HbA1c at 9 (baseline HbA1c >/=8% or >/=9%), 27, and 30 months (baseline HbA1c >/=9%). Continuous 12-month medication cost $3,326 less for CANA versus GLP-1 RA. CONCLUSION: This retrospective study demonstrated a similar evolution of HbA1c levels among CANA and GLP-1 RA patients in a real-world setting. Lower medication costs suggest CANA is economically dominant over GLP-1 RA (similar effectiveness, lower cost).

73,29547014,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with prothrombotic alterations, and postprandial hyperglycemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular complications. We therefore investigated whether a standardized mixed meal alters circulating microparticles (MPs) and their procoagulant activity in DM patients. Patients with DM type 1 (T1DM, n = 11) and type 2 (T2DM; n = 9) were studied before and 90 min after a standardized meal (without premeal insulin). MPs in plasma derived from platelets (PMPs), endothelial cells (EMPs), or monocytes (MMPs) were measured by flow cytometry. MP-induced thrombin generation in plasma was assessed by a calibrated automated thrombogram. In the fasting state, MPs did not differ significantly between T1DM and T2DM. Meal intake increased the following microparticles: PMPs expressing phosphatidylserine (by 55%, on average), P-selectin (by 86%), and tissue factor (TF; by 112%); EMPs expressing E-selectin (by 96%) and MMPs expressing TF (by 164%), with no significant group differences between T1DM and T2DM. There were no increments in EMPs expressing phosphatidylserine or TF. Meal intake increased MP-induced thrombin generation similarly in T1DM and T2DM with increased endogenous thrombin potential (p = 0.02) and peak thrombin (p = 0.03) and shortened time to peak (p = 0.02). Phosphatidylserine inhibition by lactadherin completely abolished MP-induced thrombin generation, while an anti-TF antibody had no effect. In conclusion, meal intake increased several types of circulating MPs in patients with diabetes mellitus. These MPs have a procoagulant potential, which is related to phosphatidylserine expression and negatively charged MP surfaces rather than to TF."
74,29546575,"AIMS: The relationship between obesity and mortality rate among diabetic patients is a controversial topic. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between obesity and all-cause mortality risk in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: In this retrospective database study, 2383 patients with type 2 diabetes, who had been registered in the Isfahan Endocrine and Metabolism Research Center, Iran, were enrolled between 1992 and 2010. The mean (SD) of diabetes duration and follow-up period was 15.5 (8.0) and 7.8 (3.9) years. The main outcome was all-cause mortality. All-cause mortality rates were calculated for the body mass index (BMI) categories of underweight, normal, overweight and class I, II and III obese. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio for BMI as categorical variable using BMI of 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2) as the reference group. RESULTS: The mortality rate in patients with normal weight was higher than overweight patients (59.11 vs. 33.17 per 1000 person-years). The adjusted hazard ratios of all-cause mortality were 0.82 [95%CI 0.68-0.99; P = 0.037], 0.79 [95%CI 0.61-1.02; P = 0.069], 0.71 [95%CI 0.42-1.19; P = 0.191] and 1.36 [95%CI 0.55-3.33; P = 0.507] for overweight, class I, II and III obesity, respectively. When BMI was included in the Cox model as a time-dependent variable, the U-shaped relationship between BMI and all-cause mortality did not change. CONCLUSIONS: The results show a U-shaped association of BMI with all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes with the lowest risk observed among the overweight patients."
75,29545678,"[Purpose] The purpose of the present study was to assess the relationship between age of onset and risk factors including family history and life style in Korean population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). [Subjects and Methods] Subjects with T2D patients who received outpatient care for blood sugar control were randomly sampled at 13 general hospitals and 969 subjects were included. Cox proportional hazard models were used to confirm associations between age of onset and risk factors including family history and life style in Korean population with T2D. [Results] Parent history of T2D was significantly associated with age of onset. Compared to none of family members with T2D, those whose both father and mother had a history showed the highest the risk of early-onset (HR=2.36; 95% CI=1.45-3.85). Mother and father's history of T2D (HR=1.73; 95% CI=1.46-2.05; HR=1.83; 95% CI=1.40-2.37) were associated with the risk of early-onset. Moreover, exercise (HR=1.23, CI=1.08-1.40) smoking status (HR=1.62, CI=1.32-1.99), and drinking (HR=1.32, CI=1.13-1.54) were associated with a higher risk for the early-onset.

76,29544744,"AIMS: To compare adherence and persistence to oral antidiabetic drugs (OAD) between patients who are new users of second generation antipsychotics (SGA) versus new users of other depression therapies in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and major depressive disorder (MDD). METHODS: Adults 18-64years with previously-treated T2DM and MDD (past OAD and SSRI/SNRI use) who are new users of SGA or non-SGA therapies (bupropion, lithium, mirtazapine, thyroid hormone, tricyclic antidepressant) were identified in the 2009-2015 MarketScan(R) Commercial Claims and Encounters database. Multivariate regression models were used to determine the odds of a >/=10% decline in OAD adherence over 180- and 365-days, and time to OAD discontinuation, adjusting for differences between groups. RESULTS: A total of 8664 (21.5% SGA), 8311 (22.1% SGA), and 17,524 (21.3% SGA) patients met inclusion criteria for the 180-day adherence, 365-day adherence, and persistence cohorts, respectively. Over 180-days, 16.6% of SGA and 13.3% of non-SGA initiators had a >/=10% decline in OAD adherence (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=1.41, 95% CI 1.21-1.63). Over 365-days, 22.3% of SGA and 18.9% of non-SGA initiators had a>/=10% decline (OR=1.34, 95% CI 1.17-1.53). Time to OAD discontinuation was similar between groups (adjusted hazard ratio=1.03, 95% CI 0.94-1.12). CONCLUSION: Use of SGA was associated with a 1.3-1.4 times higher odds of a >/=10% decline in OAD adherence. Adherence to OAD is critical for optimal diabetes control and reductions in this magnitude may impact A1C. Close monitoring of OAD adherence after SGA initiation is warranted."
77,29544538,"OBJECTIVES: Pathophysiological similarity exists between gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus with common genetic origin. Genetic liability for GDM in our population is still not researched. The goal was to reveal the genotypic and allele frequency differences of 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) namely, CDKAL1 (rs7754840) and CDKN2A/2B (rs10811661) between GDM pregnancies and normal pregnancies. We assessed them by real time polymerase chain reaction using Taqman((R)) allelic discrimination assays. We included 47 GDM pregnant subjects and 51 normal glucose tolerance (NGT) pregnant women as controls. RESULTS: The genotype frequencies in the GDM group and the NGT group of rs7754840-GG/GC/CC were 6.4/15.7% (3/8), 55.3/45.1% (26/23) and 38.3/39.2% (18/20) respectively. Also, those of rs10811661-CC/CT/TT were 74.5/14.9/4.3% (38/7/2) and 80.9/19.6/5.9% (38/10/3) respectively. The allele frequencies in the GDM group and the NGT group of C/G and T/C were 66/34% (62/32), 61.8/38.2% (63/39) and 11.7/88.3% (11/83), 15.7/84.3% (16/86) respectively. There were no statistical differences between the two groups in allele frequencies and genotype frequencies (all P > 0.05). Non-significant association was seen in the two SNPs of CDKAL1 and CDKN2A/B genes with GDM. Further studies are essential to validate data."
78,29544537,"BACKGROUND: DNA methylation (global and gene-specific) has been reported as an epigenetic mechanism that could be involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Furthermore, epigenetic therapy has been suggested as a future possibility for T2DM treatment. Epigenetic changes illustrate the environmental link of the disease. Since some of the epigenetic modifications can be reversed, they could be used as potential therapeutic targets. The aim of the systematic review will be to synthesise the available evidence pertaining to the link between DNA methylation and T2DM. The systematic review will evaluate characteristics of reported studies such as the source of DNA used, methods of quantifying DNA methylation and the participants' demographics (age, gender, race and adiposity). We will conduct a narrative synthesis of data, and if there are an adequate number of sufficiently homogenous studies, we will consider performing a meta-analysis. The review will evaluate if the levels of DNA methylation are a possible risk factor for T2DM. Furthermore, we will assess whether DNA methylation is a plausible biomarker and therapeutic target for the treatment and management of T2DM. METHODS: This systematic review protocol will be reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015 statement. An extensive search for original research articles, published since inception, was performed on major databases such as Embase, MEDLINE and Cochrane Library. The search strategy will include a combination of key words and MeSH words. Literature that is available in English and studies in other languages that can be translated into English will be used. Data extraction will be done in duplicate, and two authors will independently screen for eligible studies using pre-defined criteria. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool and Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal tools will be used to assess the risk of bias. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation assessment tool will be used to assess the overall quality of extracted data. DISCUSSION: This systematic review will evaluate published literature, assessing the link between DNA methylation and T2DM. Our findings could help guide future research evaluating epigenetic changes in T2DM and direct future therapeutic interventions."

RESULTS: Patients in the RA/T2DM+ group were significantly older (p < 0.0001), had a longer RA duration (p < 0.0001) and higher disease activity (p = 0.006) compared to controls. Moreover, patients in the RA/T2DM+ group had significantly higher levels of ESR (p < 0.0001), CRP (p < 0.0001) and complement C3 (p < 0.0001). A logistic regression model was built to ascertain the effect of selected variables (age, RA duration, BMI, ESR, C3, lnCRP, corticosteroid use) on the likelihood that patients have T2DM. Longer RA duration, ESR and C3 were associated with an increased likelihood of being classified as T2DM. Finally, we built ROC curves to evaluate the predictivity of RA duration, complement C3 and the combination of both variables on the likelihood of being diagnosed with T2DM. The area under the ROC curve was 0.79 (p < 0.0001) for RA duration, 0.71 (p < 0.0001) for complement C3 and 0.89 (p < 0.0001) for the combination of both variables. CONCLUSION: According to our data complement C3 levels can predict the presence of T2DM in RA patients."
81,29540227,"BACKGROUND: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with perinatal health risks to both mother and offspring, and represents a large economic burden. The DALI study is a multicenter randomized controlled trial, undertaken to add to the knowledge base on the effectiveness of interventions for pregnant women at increased risk for GDM. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the healthy eating and/or physical activity promotion intervention compared to usual care among pregnant women at increased risk of GDM from a societal perspective. METHODS: An economic evaluation was performed alongside a European multicenter-randomized controlled trial. A total of 435 pregnant women at increased risk of GDM in primary and secondary care settings in nine European countries, were recruited and randomly allocated to a healthy eating and physical activity promotion intervention (HE + PA intervention), a healthy eating promotion intervention (HE intervention), or a physical activity promotion intervention (PA intervention). Main outcome measures were gestational weight gain, fasting glucose, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and societal costs. RESULTS: Between-group total cost and effect differences were not significant, besides significantly less gestational weight gain in the HE + PA group compared with the usual care group at 35-37 weeks (-2.3;95%CI:-3.7;-0.9). Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves indicated that the HE + PA intervention was the preferred intervention strategy. At 35-37 weeks, it depends on the decision-makers' willingness to pay per kilogram reduction in gestational weight gain whether the HE + PA intervention is cost-effective for gestational weight gain, whereas it was not cost-effective for fasting glucose and HOMA-IR. After delivery, the HE + PA intervention was cost-effective for QALYs, which was predominantly caused by a large reduction in delivery-related costs. CONCLUSIONS: Healthy eating and physical activity promotion was found to be the preferred strategy for limiting gestational weight gain. As this intervention was cost-effective for QALYs after delivery, this study lends support for broad implementation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN ISRCTN70595832 . Registered 2 December 2011."
82,29539051,"BACKGROUND: Obesity is an important risk factor for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and periodontal disease. Adipocytes appear to secrete proinflammatory cytokines which may be the molecules linking the pathogenesis of these diseases. We evaluated the relationship between obesity, periodontal disease, and diabetes mellitus insulin resistance as well as the plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and its soluble receptors (sTNFalpha) to assess the relationship of inflammation to obesity, diabetes, and periodontal infections. METHODS: The relationship between periodontal disease, obesity, and insulin resistance was examined in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). In a population of 12,367 non-diabetic subjects, the variable body mass index (BMI) was used as an assessment of obesity and periodontal disease was assessed by mean clinical attachment loss. The plasma levels of TNFalpha and sTNFalpha were assessed in subsets of 1,221 adults from Erie County, New York, who represented the highest and lowest quartile of BMI. These subjects had extensive periodontal and medical evaluations. RESULTS: In the NHANES III portion of the study, BMI was positively related to severity of periodontal attachment loss (P <0.001). Weighted multiple logistic regressions showed that this relationship is likely mediated by insulin resistance, since overweight individuals (with BMI >/=27 kg/m(2) ) with high levels of insulin resistance (IR) exhibited an odds ratio of 1.48 (95% confidence interval 1.13 - 1.93) for severe periodontal disease as compared to overweight subjects with low IR. In the Erie County adult population, the highest levels of TNFalpha and sTNFalpha receptors were found in those individuals in the highest quartile of BMI. A positive correlation of TNFalpha levels with periodontal disease was found only in those in the lowest quartile of BMI. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is a significant predictor of periodontal disease and insulin resistance appears to mediate this relationship. Furthermore, obesity is associated with high plasma levels of TNFalpha and its soluble receptors, which in turn may lead to a hyperinflammatory state increasing the risk for periodontal disease and also accounting in part for insulin resistance. Further studies of the molecular basis of insulin resistance and its relationship to diabetes, periodontal disease, and obesity are necessary to fully test the hypothesis that adipocyte production of proinflammatory cytokines is a pathogenic factor linking obesity to diabetes and periodontal infections."
83,29538217,"The present study was to examine the relationship between white matter lesions (WMLs) and insulin resistance (IR) in patients with acute stroke and evaluate clinical prognosis.Around 200 patients with initial onset of acute stroke including 146 patients (73.0%) with WMLs and 54 patients (27%) without WMLs were analyzed by neuropsychological scales. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin, blood lipid, homocysteine (Hcy), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), creatinine, and uric acid, diabetes mellitus (DM), prediabetes (PD), and normal glucose (NG) were determined according to HbA1c levels. According to homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-IR index of IR, HOMA-IR index >/=2.5 indicated IR, and HOMA-IR index < 2.5 represented noninsulin resistance (NON-IR).IR values and the proportion of patients with IR, HbA1c levels and the quantity of DM patients, the levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, Hcy, and hs-CRP of patients with WMLs were significantly higher than those in patients without WMLs (all P < .05). OR value of IR exposure and WMLs was 1.862 (1.235-2.236). OR values of level 1, level 2, and level 3 WMLs were 1.632 (1.032-2.532), 1.328 (1.152-2.865), and 1.158 (0.639-3.526), respectively. Regarding WMLs patients, MoCA and MMSE scores were significantly decreased, and Hamilton Depression Scale scores were significantly increased (all P < .05). National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and modified Rankin scale scores of patients with WMLs were significantly increased, and BI scores were significantly decreased (all P < .05).IR is intimately correlated with the WMLs of acute stroke. The incidence and severity of WMLs are significantly associated with cerebral arterial thrombosis, neuropsychology, and neurological scores."
84,29536426,"INTRODUCTION: To investigate the effects of pioglitazone (PIO) on insulin resistance and first phase insulin secretion among obese and lean Chinese people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: Sixty-eight drug-naive patients with T2DM were treated with PIO for 16 weeks. Before and after the treatment, insulin sensitivity was evaluated by the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp test. Plasma insulin levels at 0, 3, 5, 7, and 10 min during intravenous glucose tolerance test were determined to calculate the first phase insulin secretion and pancreatic beta-cell function. Circulating adiponectin levels were quantified. RESULTS: In both the lean and the obese patients with T2DM, the reduction of HbA1c following the PIO treatment was more than 1% (P < 0.001) and glucose infusion rate, acute insulin response, glucose disposal index, and beta-cell glucose sensitivity increased significantly (P < 0.001). A multiple linear regression analysis showed that the improvements of first phase insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity were independently associated with the changes of HbA1c, but the change of first phase insulin secretion exhibited a higher correlation coefficient (R(2) = 0.20, P = 0.001) than the change of insulin sensitivity did (R(2) = 0.07, P = 0.040). The PIO treatment led to a significant increase in adiponectin levels only in the obese group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: A 16-week treatment of PIO significantly increased insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function in the lean group as well as in the obese group among Chinese T2DM patients, demonstrating that both lean and obese diabetic adults would profit from PIO.

85,29536165,"Parkinson's disease patients experience a wide range of non-motor symptoms that may be provoked by deposits of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein in the peripheral nervous system. Pre-existing diabetes mellitus might be a risk factor for developing Parkinson's disease, and indeed, nearly 60% of Parkinson's disease patients are insulin resistant. Thus, we have investigated whether phosphorylated alpha-synuclein is deposited in pancreatic tissue of subjects with synucleinopathies. We studied pancreatic tissue from 39 subjects diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, Lewy body Dementia or incidental Lewy bodies disease, as well as that from 34 subjects with diabetes mellitus and a normal neuropathological examination, and 52 subjects with a normal neuropathological examination. We examined the pancreatic accumulation of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein and of the islet amyloid polypeptide precursor (IAPP), an amyloidogenic protein that plays an unknown role in diabetes mellitus, but that can promote alpha-synuclein amyloid deposition in vitro. Moreover, we performed proximity ligation assays to assess whether these two proteins interact in the pancreas of these subjects. Cytoplasmic phosphorylated alpha-synuclein deposits were found in the pancreatic beta cells of 14 subjects with Parkinson's disease (93%), in 11 subjects with Lewy body Dementia (85%) and in 8 subjects with incidental Lewy body disease (73%). Furthermore, we found similar phosphorylated alpha-synuclein inclusions in 23 subjects with a normal neuropathological examination but with diabetes mellitus (68%) and in 9 control subjects (17%). In addition, IAPP/alpha-synuclein interactions appear to occur in patients with pancreatic inclusions of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein. The presence of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein inclusions in pancreatic beta cells provides a new evidence of a mechanism that is potentially common to the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus, PD and DLB. Moreover, the interaction of IAPP and alpha-synuclein in the pancreatic beta cells of patients may represent a novel target for the development of strategies to treat these diseases."
86,29535637,"Sirt6 is one of the sirtuin family members, a kind of NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase and ADP-ribose transferase enzyme. It has an important role in physiological and pathological processes, regulating aging, cancer, obesity, insulin resistance, inflammation, and energy metabolism. Recent studies have suggested that reduced Sirt6 action is related to obesity and diabetes. Aging and overnutrition, two major risk factors for obesity and diabetes, lead to decreased Sirt6 level and function, which results in abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism. Whole-body ablation of Sirt6 in mice results in severe hypoglycemia. Sirt6 deficiency leads to liver steatosis and promotes diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Sirt6 has a protective effect on obesity and diabetes. This review surveys evidence for an emerging role of Sirt6 as a regulator of metabolism in mammals and summarizes its major functions in obesity and diabetes."
87,29533548,"Diabetes mellitus is a systemic disease which affects patients of various age. Hyperglycemia induces damage of vascular endothelium, development of chronic inflammation, organic and functional lesions in several systems and organs. The principal gastroenterological complaints linked to the manifestation of the disease include abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, flatulence, and vomiting. However, complications in the alimentary system may manifest exclusively by difficulties in reaching normoglycemia and numerous persistent episodes of hypoglycemia. The most frequent complication of diabetes mellitus affecting the alimentary tract involves gastroparesis and disturbances in pancreatic function. Diabetes may also aggravate other coexisting diseases, such as gastroesophageal reflux or periodontitis. Subject-based references accentuate also a significantly more frequent manifestation together with diabetes of other autoimmune diseases, such as celiac disease or autoimmune gastritis. Also, a hepatic microangiopathy and increased incidence of certain tumors, linked to the manifestation of insulin resistance, may be regarded to represent complications of long-term diabetes. Rapid diagnosis and adequate treatment may significantly improve a patient's quality of life and influence the prolonged control of glycemia. Nevertheless, this requires a rigorous analysis of the signs and clinical condition of a patient as well as individualization of recommendations and therapy."
88,29529688,"INTRODUCTION: Endothelial dysfunction is involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus type 2, diabetic complications and preceded clinical manifestation of cardiovascular complications. Increased myeloperoxidase activity has been linked to a number of pathologies with compelling evidence in initiation and progression of inflammatory events. The aim of this study was to compare concentrations of metabolite nitric oxide and myeloperoxidase in the plasma of diabetes mellitus type 2 patients on metformin therapy, without clinical signs of cardiovascular disease and healthy subjects, as well as evaluation of concentrations of analytes in association with glycemic control. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty four study subjects with diabetes mellitus type 2 and thirty healthy subjects were included in this study. The concentration of myeloperoxidase was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the concentration of nitrate and nitrite with high performance liquid chromatography method. Student's t test, Mann-Whitney U test, Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The mean concentration of myeloperoxidase was significantly higher in the diabetic group compared to the control group (16.2+/-4.9 vs. 3.7+/-1.8; P<0.001).The nitrite concentration was comparable in both groups while the concentration of nitrate was significantly higher in the diabetic group (41.2 [42.9] vs 31.9 [23]; P=0.017). In this study, plasma myeloperoxidase (Spearman's rho=0.421; P=0.004) and nitrate concentration was significantly positively associated with the HbA1c levels while nitrate concentration (Spearman's rho=- 0.308; P=0.047) were was significantly positively negatively associated with the HbA1c levels. CONCLUSION: Concertation of MPO and nitric oxide were significantly increased in a T2DM subject even when on metformin therapy. However, increased concentration of NO strongly correlates with lower levels of HbA1c showing a postive effect of a gylcemic control on endothelial dysfuction. Increased concentrations of NO3- in T2DM subject compared to control, indicates the variety of NO pathways that should be taken into consideration win relation to endothelial function."
89,29528260,"AIM: In recent years, survival rates of childhood cancers have significantly increased, and occurrence of long-term adverse late effects (eg, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, hypertension) has become increasingly important. Early diagnosis of obesity/hypertension in childhood is essential to avoid morbidity in the adulthood. Therefore, this study was aimed to determine the blood pressure (BP) profile by ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) method, and prevalence of hypertension, obesity, abdominal obesity among childhood cancer survivors. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The study was carried out with 52 cancer survivors. The ABPM measurement was performed during 24 hours. The anthropometric measurements of patients were performed using standardized protocols. The body composition analysis was performed with bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) method. Statistical significance was considered at p < 0.05. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 12.84 +/- 3.88 years. Time off therapy ranged 24-125 month. The prevalence of prehypertension and hypertension were 57.7% and 9.6%, respectively. There was no statistically significant relationship between diagnosis and BP status (p = 0.59). The prevalence of obesity, and abdominal obesity were 1.9% and 30.4%, respectively. There was a positive correlation between waist circumference (WC) and time off therapy (p = 0.046). The WC was found to be higher in patients who received cranial irradiation (p = 0.048). Weight/WC were higher in patients who used corticosteroids in the treatment (p = 0.019). CONCLUSION: Careful follow up of BP, weight and WC is necessary for long-term cancer survivors to prevent complications. Especially patients who receive cranial radiotherapy and use corticosteroid are at increased risk of abdominal obesity."

91,29483906,"About two decades ago, cloning of the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene materialized one of the most important actors on the scene of self-tolerance. Thymic transcription of genes encoding tissue-specific antigens (ts-ags) is activated by AIRE protein and embodies the essence of thymic self-representation. Pathogenic AIRE variants cause the autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1, which is a rare and complex disease that is gaining attention in research on autoimmunity. The animal models of disease, although not identically reproducing the human picture, supply fundamental information on mechanisms and extent of AIRE action: thanks to its multidomain structure, AIRE localizes to chromatin enclosing the target genes, binds to histones, and offers an anchorage to multimolecular complexes involved in initiation and post-initiation events of gene transcription. In addition, AIRE enhances mRNA diversity by favoring alternative mRNA splicing. Once synthesized, ts-ags are presented to, and cause deletion of the self-reactive thymocyte clones. However, AIRE function is not restricted to the activation of gene transcription. AIRE would control presentation and transfer of self-antigens for thymic cellular interplay: such mechanism is aimed at increasing the likelihood of engagement of the thymocytes that carry the corresponding T-cell receptors. Another fundamental role of AIRE in promoting self-tolerance is related to the development of thymocyte anergy, as thymic self-representation shapes at the same time the repertoire of regulatory T cells. Finally, AIRE seems to replicate its action in the secondary lymphoid organs, albeit the cell lineage detaining such property has not been fully characterized. Delineation of AIRE functions adds interesting data to the knowledge of the mechanisms of self-tolerance and introduces exciting perspectives of therapeutic interventions against the related diseases."
92,29377640,"BACKGROUND: Infants of diabetic mothers have been shown in several studies to have an increased frequency of malformations. In previous studies, an increased frequency of several specific malformations has been noted, including anencephaly, bilateral renal agenesis, and double outlet right ventricle. Surveillance, used to identify all malformed infants in a consecutive sample of births, can identify a distinctive pattern of malformations among the affected infants. METHODS: The infants of insulin-dependent, pregestational diabetic mothers were identified in the daily review of the medical records of each newborn infant with a malformation and her/his mother's medical record. Infants of mothers with gestational diabetes were excluded. The frequency of each malformation was compared to that among the malformed infants of nondiabetic mothers. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-three malformed infants of diabetic mothers were identified among the 289,365 births. The most notable malformations were: neural tube defects (anencephaly, 9%), heart defects (transposition of great arteries, 4%), bilateral renal agenesis or dysgenesis (6%), and vertebral anomalies (hemivertebrae, 4%). CONCLUSIONS: There was a recognizable pattern of malformations and characteristics of infants of diabetic mothers, although there was variation in the pattern among affected infants. Some of the malformations in the diabetic embryopathy can be identified in prenatal screening by ultrasound. More important, their occurrence can be reduced significantly by the mother achieving much better control of her diabetes mellitus prior to conception."
93,29344042,"Background: Diabetes is a serious chronic disease during childhood. Because of the chronic nature of the disease, self-care is necessary. Education alone is not effective in providing care. Misunderstanding by the patients regarding diabetes during the training programs render telephone follow-up after training essential. Materials and Methods: This quasi-experimental study with two groups (experimental and control) was conducted in two phases in 2014. The study population consisted of 70 children of 10-18 years of age with type I diabetes (35 patients in the experimental group and 35 in the control group). The participants were randomly selected from the patients referring to the Sedigheh Tahereh Diabetic Research and Treatment Center in Isfahan, Iran. Data were collected using a researcher-made questionnaire on self-care and a glycosylated hemoglobin recording form. The experimental group received 12 weeks of telephone follow-up training by the center, whereas the control group received no follow-up. Results: The results showed that, after intervention, the total mean score of self-care in all aspects of diabetes care for children was significantly higher in the experimental group (p < 0.001). In addition, a statistically significant difference was observed between the experimental and control groups in terms of mean glycosylated hemoglobin after the intervention (p = 0.030). Conclusions: It can be concluded that telephone follow-up by a nurse can improve total self-care and glycosylated hemoglobin in patients with type I diabetes."
94,29329330,"BACKGROUND: Rising prevalence of childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an emerging public health issue. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association of maternal hyperglycemia exposure during pregnancy with obesity and abnormal glucose tolerance in offspring, and the age at occurrence. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for observational studies on obesity and diabetes in offspring of diabetic mothers (gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and T2DM), and those on non-diabetic mothers. We performed fixed effect meta-analysis for all studies except when heterogeneity was detected. The quality of studies was evaluated using the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Nonrandomized Studies (RoBANS). RESULTS: Twenty observational studies were included involving a total of 26,509 children. Offspring of GDM mother had higher BMI z-score in childhood (pooled MD: 0.14, 95%CI: 0.04-0.24, seven studies, 21,691children, low quality of evidence). Offspring of T1DM mothers had higher BMI z-score from prepubertal to adolescent (pooled MD: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.13-0.58, three studies, 844 children, low quality of evidence) compared with control. After adjustment for maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, this association remained in offspring of T1DM, but disappeared in those of GDM mothers. Offspring of GDM mother had higher 2-hour plasma glucose from prepubertal to early adulthood (pooled MD: 0.43 mmol/L, 95% CI: 0.18-0.69, five studies, 890 children), while those of T1DM mothers had higher rate of T2DM in 2-5 years old to early adulthood (pooled odds ratio [OR], 6.10: 95% CI: 1.23-30.37, two studies, 448 children, very low quality of evidence) compared with control. As there was only one study with offspring of T2DM mothers, evidence is sparse. LIMITATIONS: Only observational studies were included, with a few adequately adjusted for covariables. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to maternal hyperglycemia was associated with offspring obesity and abnormal glucose tolerance especially in offspring of T1DM mothers, but the evidence relies on observational studies with low quality of evidence only."
95,29308448,"Context: Multiple consensus statements decree that women with diabetes mellitus should have comparable birth outcomes to women without diabetes mellitus; however, there is a scarcity of contemporary population-based studies on this issue. Objective: To examine temporal trends in obstetric interventions and perinatal outcomes in a population-based cohort of women with type 1, type 2, or gestational diabetes mellitus compared with a control population. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: National hospitalization data (Canada except Quebec) from 2004 to 2015. Patients: Pregnant women with type 1 (n = 7362), type 2 (n = 11,028), and gestational diabetes mellitus (n = 149,780) and women without diabetes mellitus (n = 2,688,231). Main Outcome Measures: Rates of obstetric intervention, maternal morbidity, and neonatal morbidity/mortality. Results: A consistent relationship was generally observed between diabetes mellitus subtype and obstetric outcomes, with women with type 1 diabetes mellitus having the highest rate of intervention and the highest rates of adverse perinatal outcomes followed by women with type 2 diabetes mellitus and women with gestational diabetes mellitus. Rates of severe preeclampsia were 1.2% among women without diabetes mellitus, 2.1% among women with gestational diabetes mellitus, 4.2% among women with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and 7.5% among women with type 1 diabetes mellitus (P < 0.001). The rate of neonatal morbidity ranged from 8.7% in women without diabetes mellitus to 11.0%, 17.4%, and 24.1% in women with gestational, type 2, and type 1 diabetes mellitus, respectively (P < 0.001).

96,29298776,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of type 1 diabetes in all age groups in China during 2010-13. DESIGN: Population based, registry study using data from multiple independent sources. SETTING: National registration system in all 505 hospitals providing diabetes care, and communities of patients with diabetes in 13 areas across China, covering more than 133 million person years at risk, approximately 10% of the whole population. PARTICIPANTS: 5018 people of all ages with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes and resident in the study areas from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2013. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of type 1 diabetes per 100 000 person years by age, sex, and study area. Type 1 diabetes was doctor diagnosed and further validated by onsite follow-up. Completeness of case ascertainment was assessed using the capture mark recapture method. RESULTS: 5018 cases of newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes were ascertained: 1239 participants were aged <15 years, 1799 were aged 15-29 years, and 1980 were aged >/=30 years. The proportion of new onset cases in participants aged >/=20 years was 65.3%. The estimated incidence of type 1 diabetes per 100 000 persons years for all ages in China was 1.01 (95% confidence interval 0.18 to 1.84). Incidence per 100 000 persons years by age group was 1.93 (0.83 to 3.03) for 0-14 years, 1.28 (0.45 to 2.11) for 15-29 years, and 0.69 (0.00 to 1.51) for >/=30 years, with a peak in age group 10-14 years. The incidence in under 15s was positively correlated with latitude (r=0.88, P<0.001), although this association was not observed in age groups 15-29 years or >/=30 years. CONCLUSION: Most cases of new onset type 1 diabetes in China occurred among adults. The incidence of type 1 diabetes in Chinese children was among the lowest reported in the study."
97,29297078,"Importance: Early exposure to complex dietary proteins may increase the risk of type 1 diabetes in children with genetic disease susceptibility. There are no intact proteins in extensively hydrolyzed formulas. Objective: To test the hypothesis that weaning to an extensively hydrolyzed formula decreases the cumulative incidence of type 1 diabetes in young children. Design, Setting, and Participants: An international double-blind randomized clinical trial of 2159 infants with human leukocyte antigen-conferred disease susceptibility and a first-degree relative with type 1 diabetes recruited from May 2002 to January 2007 in 78 study centers in 15 countries; 1081 were randomized to be weaned to the extensively hydrolyzed casein formula and 1078 to a conventional formula. The follow-up of the participants ended on February 28, 2017. Interventions: The participants received either a casein hydrolysate or a conventional adapted cow's milk formula supplemented with 20% of the casein hydrolysate. The minimum duration of study formula exposure was 60 days by 6 to 8 months of age. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was type 1 diabetes diagnosed according to World Health Organization criteria. Secondary outcomes included age at diabetes diagnosis and safety (adverse events). Results: Among 2159 newborn infants (1021 female [47.3%]) who were randomized, 1744 (80.8%) completed the trial. The participants were observed for a median of 11.5 years (quartile [Q] 1-Q3, 10.2-12.8). The absolute risk of type 1 diabetes was 8.4% among those randomized to the casein hydrolysate (n = 91) vs 7.6% among those randomized to the conventional formula (n = 82) (difference, 0.8% [95% CI, -1.6% to 3.2%]). The hazard ratio for type 1 diabetes adjusted for human leukocyte antigen risk group, duration of breastfeeding, duration of study formula consumption, sex, and region while treating study center as a random effect was 1.1 (95% CI, 0.8 to 1.5; P = .46). The median age at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes was similar in the 2 groups (6.0 years [Q1-Q3, 3.1-8.9] vs 5.8 years [Q1-Q3, 2.6-9.1]; difference, 0.2 years [95% CI, -0.9 to 1.2]). Upper respiratory infections were the most common adverse event reported (frequency, 0.48 events/year in the hydrolysate group and 0.50 events/year in the control group). Conclusions and Relevance: Among infants at risk for type 1 diabetes, weaning to a hydrolyzed formula compared with a conventional formula did not reduce the cumulative incidence of type 1 diabetes after median follow-up for 11.5 years. These findings do not support a need to revise the dietary recommendations for infants at risk for type 1 diabetes. Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00179777."
98,29233026,"4-Methyl-2-[(2-methylbenzyl) amino]-1,3-thiazole-5-carboxylic acid (bioactive compound (BAC)), a novel thiazole derivative, is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor and free radical scavenging agent. Effects of BAC on hyperglycemia, insulin sensitivity, oxidative stress, and inflammatory mediators were evaluated in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced neonatal models of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) rats where NIDDM was induced in neonatal pups with single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (100 mg/kg). The effect of BAC (10 and 20 mg/kg, p.o.) for 3 weeks was evaluated by the determination of blood glucose, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), HbA1c level, insulin level, insulin sensitivity, and insulin resistance (IR). Furthermore, inflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6) and oxidative stress were estimated in serum and pancreatic tissue, respectively. Significant alteration in the level of blood glucose, OGTT, HbA1c, insulin level, insulin sensitivity, in addition variation in the antioxidant status and inflammatory mediators, and alteration in histoarchitecture of pancreatic tissue confirmed the potential of BAC in STZ-induced neonatal models of NIDDM rats. Pretreatment with BAC restored the level of glucose by decreasing the IR and increasing the insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, BAC balanced the antioxidant status and preserved the inflammatory mediators. Histological studies of pancreatic tissues showed normal architecture after BAC administration to diabetic rats. Altogether, our results suggest that BAC successfully reduces the blood glucose level and possesses antioxidant as well as anti-inflammatory activities. This leads to decreased histological damage in diabetic pancreatic tissues, suggesting the possibility of future diabetes treatments."

The present study utilizes nationwide data to compare the incidence of type 1 diabetes in youth (0-19 years) to that of adults (20-64 years). METHODS: In this longitudinal study, the Clinformatics(R) Data Mart Database was used, which contains information from 61 million commercially insured Americans (years 2001-2015). Incidence rates and exact Poisson 95% confidence intervals were calculated by age group, sex, census division, and year of diagnosis. Changes in rates over time were assessed by negative binomial regression. RESULTS: Overall, there were 32,476 individuals who developed type 1 diabetes in the cohort. The incidence rate was greatest in youth aged 10-14 years (45.5 cases/100,000 person-years); however, because adulthood spans over a longer period than childhood, there was a greater number of new cases in adults than in youth (n = 19,174 adults; n = 13,302 youth). Predominance in males was evident by age 10 and persisted throughout adulthood. The male to female incidence rate ratio was 1.32 (95% CI 1.30-1.35). The incidence rate of type 1 diabetes in youth increased by 1.9% annually from 2001 to 2015 (95% CI 1.1-2.7%; P < 0.001), but there was variation across regions. The greatest increases were in the East South Central (3.8%/year; 95% CI 2.0-5.6%; P < 0.001) and Mountain divisions (3.1%/year; 95% CI 1.6-4.6%; P < 0.001). There were also increases in the East North Central (2.7%/year; P = 0.010), South Atlantic (2.4%/year; P < 0.001), and West North Central divisions (2.4%/year; P < 0.001). In adults, however, the incidence decreased from 2001 to 2015 (-1.3%/year; 95% CI -2.3% to -0.4%; P = 0.007). Greater percentages of cases were diagnosed in January, July, and August for both youth and adults. The number of new cases of type 1 diabetes (ages 0-64 years) in the United States is estimated at 64,000 annually (27,000 cases in youth and 37,000 cases in adults). CONCLUSIONS: There are more new cases of type 1 diabetes occurring annually in the United States than previously recognized. The increase in incidence rates in youth, but not adults, suggests that the precipitating factors of youth-onset disease may differ from those of adult-onset disease."
100,29527407,"Neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) is a monogenic form of diabetes occurring within 6 months from birth. NDM can be permanent or transient (TNDM). We report the case of a preterm infant with TNDM due to an ABCC8 mutation identified by next-generation sequencing. The pancreatic adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive K+ (K-ATP) channel is a key regulator of insulin secretion. Gain-of-function mutations in the genes encoding the Kir6.2 (KCNJ11) and SUR1 (ABCC8) subunits of the channel cause neonatal diabetes. The patient was successfully managed with insulin lispro at a 1:100 dilution, drawn up in an insulin pen injector with a 4-mm needle. The insulin lispro dilution allowed administration of the exact insulin doses, obtaining a good glycemic control and minimizing the burden of injections. At 2 months, corrected age insulin doses were progressively decreased until discontinuation."
101,29504184,"Chromosome 6 abnormalities such as paternal uniparental isodisomy, paternal 6q24 duplication, and maternal DMR (differentially methylated region) hypomethylation are a common cause of transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM). Oral sulfonylurea (SU) is used off-label to treat permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus owing to potassium channel mutation but has not been evaluated in TNDM. Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SU therapy in chromosome 6-related TNDM. Description of 3 case reports and literature review was the subject of the study. SU therapy was successful in 2 patients (initiated during neonatal life in 1 patient and during relapse in the other) but failed in the other despite the use of high dosage. The literature review identified 11 cases of patients with chromosome 6-related TNDM treated with SU, including 4 treated before remission and 7 after the relapse. SU therapy was consistently effective, although 4 patients treated after the relapse required multiple oral medications. None of the patients needed associated insulin therapy. No side effects of SU or complications of diabetes were reported. SU seems effective and safe in chromosome 6-related TNDM treatment when used to treat the initial episode of diabetes or the relapse. It improves patients' and families' quality of life. SU is available only as oral tablets. A pediatric dosage form would facilitate the treatment of neonates and infants."
102,29474476,"Diabetes mellitus is associated with sensory abnormalities, including exacerbated responses to painful (hyperalgesia) or non-painful (allodynia) stimuli. These abnormalities are symptoms of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), which is the most common complication that affects approximately 50% of diabetic patients. Yet, the underlying mechanisms linking hyperglycemia and symptoms of DPN remain poorly understood. The transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel plays a central role in such sensory abnormalities and shows elevated expression levels in animal models of diabetes. Here, we investigated the function of TRPV1 channels in sensory neurons cultured from the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) of neonatal mice, under control (5mM) and high glucose (25mM) conditions. After maintaining DRG neurons in high glucose for 1 week, we observed a significant increase in capsaicin (CAP)-evoked currents and CAP-evoked depolarizations, independent of TRPV1 channel expression. These functional changes were largely dependent on the expression of the receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE), calcium influx, cytoplasmic ROS accumulation, PKC, and Src kinase activity. Like cultured neurons from neonates, mature neurons from adult mice also displayed a similar potentiation of CAP-evoked currents in the high glucose condition. Taken together, our data demonstrate that under the diabetic condition, DRG neurons are directly affected by elevated levels of glucose, independent of vascular or glial signals, and dependent on RAGE expression. These early cellular and molecular changes to sensory neurons in vitro are potential mechanisms that might contribute to sensory abnormalities that can occur in the very early stages of diabetes."
103,29386451,"The deficiency or excess intake of trace elements, including zinc, copper, selenium and iodine, has often been reported. Zinc deficiency is often observed in infants fed breast milk with low zinc concentration, individuals administered chelating medicines, athletes and patients with diabetes mellitus, hepatic cirrhosis or nephrosis syndrome. Menkes disease is associated with severe copper deficiency, and there is no effective treatment. Deficiencies of selenium and iodine are observed in patients who receive special formulas of milk and enteral formula with low selenium and iodine concentrations, respectively. In contrast, neonatal transient hypothyroidism due to excess intake of iodine in pregnant women has also reported in Japan. It is expected that collaborative studies by researchers and clinicians will contribute to clarify the detail mechanism, diagnosis and treatment of these abnormalities."
104,29375830,"Neonatal diabetes mellitus is underdiagnosed in the neonatal period because of the metabolic adaptation capacities of the newborns. However, it is associated with increased risk of short- and long-term morbidity; when transient it may recurs in adulthood. It is important to improve screening and early management with appropriate guidelines."
105,29116606,"Fanconi-Bickel syndrome, caused by mutations in SLC2A2 encoding the glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), is characterized by generalized proximal renal tubular dysfunction manifesting in late infancy. We describe phenotypic heterogeneity of Fanconi-Bickel syndrome in three siblings, including early and atypical presentation with transient neonatal diabetes mellitus in one. The second-born of a non-consanguineous couple, evaluated for polyuria and growth retardation, had rickets, hepatomegaly and proximal tubular dysfunction from 4 to 6 months of age. A male sibling, who expired at 4 months, also had hepatomegaly and growth retardation. The third sibling had polyuria, glucosuria and mild proteinuria on day 3 of life. Hyperglycemia was detected 2 weeks later, which required therapy with insulin for 3 months. Mild metabolic acidosis was present at 2 weeks; hypercalciuria, phosphaturia and aminoaciduria were seen at 6 months. Sanger sequencing showed a homozygous missense mutation in SLC2A2 (exon 7, c.952G > A), causing glycine to arginine substitution; both parents were heterozygous carriers. Patients with SLC2A2 mutations may present either with isolated neonatal diabetes or with hepatomegaly and the renal Fanconi syndrome. Fanconi-Bickel syndrome shows phenotypic heterogeneity and may manifest early with subtle or atypical features, mandating a high index of suspicion."
106,29048742,"BACKGROUND: Methylation defects at chromosome 6q24 usually induce transient neonatal diabetes mellitus. There are few reports of permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus caused by abnormalities of 6q24. We report the first case of permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus to be associated with confirmed methylation defects at chromosome 6q24. CASE REPORT: A baby girl, small for her gestational age, was found to have high blood glucose 1 day after birth, with no systematic congenital anomalies. She showed no remission of diabetes and has hitherto been reliant on insulin (now aged of 5.5 years), which supports a diagnosis of permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus. The single nucleotide polymorphism array and highly polymorphic short tandem repeat analysis identified paternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 6, and a genome-wide analysis ruled out mutations in coding and non-coding regions. CONCLUSION: This report expands the varieties of neonatal diabetes known to be induced by methylation defects at chromosome 6q24, and suggests that the diagnostic evaluation of permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus should be expanded to include testing for 6q24."
107,28985358,"PLAGL1/ZAC1 undergoes parental genomic imprinting, is paternally expressed, and is a member of the imprinted gene network (IGN). It encodes a zinc finger transcription factor with anti-proliferative activity and is a candidate tumor suppressor gene on 6q24 whose expression is frequently lost in various neoplasms. Conversely, gain of PLAGL1 function is responsible for transient neonatal diabetes mellitus, a rare genetic disease that results from defective pancreas development. In the present work, we showed that Plagl1 up-regulation was not associated with DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest. It was rather associated with physiological cell cycle exit that occurred with contact inhibition, growth factor withdrawal, or cell differentiation. To gain insights into Plagl1 mechanism of action, we identified Plagl1 target genes by combining chromatin immunoprecipitation and genome-wide transcriptomics in transfected cell lines. Plagl1-elicited gene regulation correlated with multiple binding to the proximal promoter region through a GC-rich motif. Plagl1 target genes included numerous genes involved in signaling, cell adhesion, and extracellular matrix composition, including collagens. Plagl1 targets also included 22% of the 409 genes that make up the IGN. Altogether, this work identified Plagl1 as a transcription factor that coordinated the regulation of a subset of IGN genes and controlled extracellular matrix composition."
108,28957425,"The imprinted gene PLAGL1 is an important regulator of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Loss of its expression has been implicated in tumorigenesis in a range of different cancers, and overexpression during fetal development causes transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM). PLAGL1 lies within an imprinted region of chromosome 6q24, and monoallelic expression from the major, differentially methylated promoter (P1) occurs in most human tissues. However, in peripheral blood leukocytes, the active promoter (P2) is non-imprinted and drives biallelic transcription. We report here a novel PLAGL1 promoter (P5) derived from the insertion of a primate-specific, MIR3 SINE retrotransposon. P5 is highly utilized in lymphocytes, particularly in T cells, and like P2, directs biallelic transcription. Our results show that it is important to consider P5 in relation to PLAGL1 function in T cells when investigating the dysregulation of this gene."
109,28943514,"BACKGROUND: Neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) is a rare type of monogenic diabetes that presents in the first 6 months of life. Activating mutations in the KCNJ11 gene encoding for the Kir6.2 subunit of the KATP channel can lead to transient (TNDM) or permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM). CASE REPORT: A female infant presented at the 22nd day of life with severe hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis (glucose: 907mg/dl, blood gas pH: 6.84, HCO3: 6mmol/l). She was initially managed with intravenous (IV) fluids and IV insulin. Ketoacidosis resolved within 48 hours and she was started on subcutaneous insulin injections with intermediate acting insulin NPH twice daily requiring initially 0.75-1.35 IU/kg/d. Pre-prandial C-peptide levels were 0.51 ng/ml (normal: 1.77-4.68). Insulin requirements were gradually reduced and insulin administration was discontinued at the age of 10 months with normal subsequent glucose and HbA1c levels. C-peptide levels normalized (pre-prandial: 1.6 ng/ml, postprandial: 2 ng/ml). Genetic analysis identified a novel missense mutation (p.Pro254Gln) in the KCNJ11 gene. CONCLUSION: We report a novel KCNJ11 mutation in a patient who presented in the first month of life with a phenotype of NDM that subsided at the age of 10 months. It is likely that the novel p.P254Q mutation results in mild impairment of the KATP channel function leading to TNDM."
110,29545427,"Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in new-onset type 1 diabetes (T1D). Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), however, is a very rare complication of DKA. We present the case of a patient with new-onset T1D who presented with DKA. He received intravenous fluid resuscitation, insulin and potassium supplementation and subsequently developed SVT, confirmed on a 12-lead electrocardiograph despite a structurally normal heart. Vagal manoeuvres and adenosine failed to restore sinus rhythm, but flecainide was successful. We conclude that SVT can occur as a complication of DKA, including in new-onset T1D. Our case is the first of this phenomenon occurring in new-onset childhood diabetes, as the few prior documented cases had established diabetes. Furthermore, a combination of potassium derangement, hypophosphataemia and falling magnesium levels may have precipitated the event."
111,29544233,"BACKGROUND: Diabetic ketoacidosis and the hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state are the most serious diabetic emergencies. Before the discovery of insulin in 1921 by Banting and Best the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes was fatal ending in diabetic ketoacidosis equivalent to a torturous death. Today, mortality from diabetic ketoacidosis is low at approximately 2 %. But each death from these two acute metabolic complications of diabetes is potentially avoidable by improved patient and healthcare professional education. Therefore, there is a need to raise awareness of hyperglycemic crisis and its management amongst physicians. PATHOGENESIS: Insulin deficiency or resistence and increased concentrations of counterreulatory hormones (glucagon, catecholamines, cortisol and growth hormone) are responsible for the development of diabetic ketoacidosis and the hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state. Hyperglycemia develops as a result of increased gluconeogenesis and accelerated glyconeogenesis. In DKA, the absolute insulin deficiency additionally leads to increased lipolysis and production of ketone bodies and resulting metabolic acidosis. DIAGNOSIS: Both DKA and HHS require prompt recognition and management. The diagnosis can be suspected by clinical features and confirmed by laboratory findings. TREATMENT: The treatment of DKA and HHS is similar, including correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities and the administration of insulin."
112,29542418,"BACKGROUND: Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious complication of diabetes seen commonly in autoimmune Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), however patients with Type 2 diabetes are also at risk. Diabetic ketoacidosis may be precipitated by the catabolic stress of acute illness such as trauma, surgery, or infections. Recent studies have suggested that sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors precipitate DKA in Type 2 diabetes. We present a case series of four patients on SGLT-2 inhibitors who presented with DKA. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed and patients who were admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis in the last one year at our institute were identified. The charts of such patients were reviewed and we were able to identify 4 patients who were admitted with DKA and were on SGLT-2 inhibitors at the time of admission for the management of their diabetes. RESULTS: The age group of the four patients was between 45-65 years. Interestingly all four patients were female. The admission blood glucose levels of these patients ranged from 203 to 400(mg/dl). The pH at the time of admission was in the acidotic range with anion gap ranging from 19 to 24. Two of these four patients had symptoms of a localized infection at the time of admission, which was confirmed by laboratory and radiological evaluation. Three of these patients required management in the intensive care unit. CONCLUSION: Ketoacidosis is a rare but serious side effect of SGLT2 inhibitors. It is being increasingly reported as these drugs are now commonly being prescribed in the primary care setting. Awareness that DKA can occur in the setting of relative euglycemia is critical to recognize this life-threatening complication of diabetes. More research is needed to better understand the underlying pathophysiology and precipitating factors leading to ketoacidosis in SGLT-2 inhibitor treated patients."
113,29537892,"INTRODUCTION: There is a clear unmet clinical need in people with Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) considering present day insulin therapy. New insulin analogues and novel technologies allowing more tailored insulin administration have improved the quality of life of people with T1DM, but issues like hypoglycemia, weight gain and variability in glucose profiles remain problematic. Areas covered: In this review, the clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability of dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitor, in type 1 diabetes (T1DM) is described based on a review of phase 2 and 3 studies to date. Expert opinion: Dapagliflozin has shown promising results as an adjunct therapy in T1DM, resulting in better glucose control, weight loss and lower blood pressure. No increase in hypoglycemia risk, in particular severe hypoglycemia, was observed, but, in comparison with reports in Type 2 diabetes (T2DM), genital infections were more prevalent. Dapagliflozin use was accompanied with decreases in insulin doses, but, to date, only a low risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) was reported. However, caution is needed when interpreting this data, arising from well controlled clinical trials, with intensive education programs around ketone measurements and DKA prevention. Further studies will need to establish how high the DKA risk is and how to mitigate this in a real-world setting."
114,29537213,"BACKGROUND: The objectives were to describe the frequency of clinical presentation at the onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and to estimate the prevalence of T1DM among children and adolescents in the AL-Baha region, Saudi Arabia, aiming for early diagnosis of T1DM. METHODS: The clinical and laboratory data of 471 children and adolescents who presented with T1DM and received medical care at an AL-Baha diabetic center during the period from 2007 to 2016 were retrospectively analyzed based on the records. RESULTS: The prevalence of T1DM in the AL-Baha region was 355 per 100,000 population in participants aged from 0 to 19 years. T1DM was more common among girls than boys (57.5% vs. 42.5%, respectively; p=0.3), and the female/male ratio was 1.36 in favor of girls. Hyperglycemic symptoms were the most frequent symptoms at presentation [59.2% vs. 40.8% with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)], and 37% of them presented with loss of weight. Most of the ketoacidosis was mild to moderate (80.2%), while only 19.8% of children had the severe type and DKA was more common (55.2%) among females. The mean age at diagnosis of T1DM was 8.2+/-3.5 years for all patients, and 8.3+/-3.9 and 8.9+/-3.6 years for boys and girls, respectively (p=0.06). Hyperglycemic symptoms were more common in spring (15.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of type 1 diabetes in the AL-Baha region was 355 per 100,000 population, which is one of the highest reported prevalences in this age group. Hyperglycemic symptoms were the most encountered symptoms at the onset of the presentation of T1DM and this may help in early detection of diabetic symptoms by patients and physicians to avoid the more severe types of presentation."
115,29534994,"AIMS: To identify a) determinants of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) at 18 and 30 months following transition in young people with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) to a youth-specific diabetes service; and to b) evaluate the impact of the service on acute admissions with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) over a 14-year period. METHODS: An audit of records of youth with T1DM referred from paediatric services to the multidisciplinary transition service at Westmead Hospital, from 2001-2012, and followed-up to 2014. RESULTS: Data from 439 adolescents and young adults (Median age: 18) were analysed. The recommended standard of glycaemic control, HbA1c <7.5% (58 mmol/mol), was achieved by 23% at baseline, 22% at 18-months, and 20% at 30-month. After adjusting for lag time (>3 months) and diabetes duration (>7 years), glycaemic control at first visit predicted subsequent glycaemic control at 18-month and 30-month follow-up. From 2001 to 2014, only 8.6% were lost to follow-up; admissions and readmissions for DKA reduced from 72% (32/47) to 4% (14/340) (p<0.001). Furthermore, mean length of stay (LOS) significantly decreased from 6.56 to 2.36 days (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Continuing engagement with the multidisciplinary transition service prevented deterioration in HbA1c following transition. Age-appropriate education and regular follow-up prevents DKA admissions and significantly reduced admission LOS."
116,29531931,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) secondary to diabetic ketoacidosis has been rarely reported and is considered as a rare complication. If left untreated, this condition could be life threatening with considerable morbidity and mortality. Herein, we report a 6-year-old girl with reduced consciousness and respiratory distress with a history of polydipsia and polyuria in the 2 weeks before hospitalization. The patient was initially diagnosed as diabetic ketoacidosis based on clinical and laboratory findings and treated accordingly. After treatment and during hospitalization although she had gained relative consciousness, she experienced seizure and reduced consciousness again. Considering laboratory and clinical findings and the patient's underlying conditions (thrombocytopenia, renal failure, and high lactate dehydrogenase), TTP was suspected although ADAMTS13 test could not be done. Treatment with plasmapheresis was initiated, and after 48 h, the patient was conscious, and laboratory indices became normal within a few days. The patient was discharged after full recovery. TTP should be considered as a rare complication of diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with thrombocytopenia, renal failure, and reduced consciousness and should be immediately treated."
117,29529345,Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are an emerging class of oral hypoglycaemic agents with therapeutic benefits beyond better glycaemic control. A major concern of the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors is their propensity to cause euglycaemic ketoacidosis in the peri-operative period and the potential for this critical diagnosis to be delayed or missed entirely. This review attempts to collate the case reports of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor ketoacidosis associated with surgery to highlight and put a perspective on this peri-operative issue. Preventive strategies and the management of the ketoacidosis are discussed.
118,29527255,"Glycogenic hepatopathy (GH) is a rare complication of the poorly controlled diabetes mellitus characterized by the transient liver dysfunction with elevated liver enzymes and associated hepatomegaly caused by the reversible accumulation of excess glycogen in the hepatocytes. It is predominantly seen in patients with longstanding type 1 diabetes mellitus and rarely reported in association with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although it was first observed in the pediatric population, since then, it has been reported in adolescents and adults with or without ketoacidosis. The association of GH with hyperglycemia in diabetes has not been well established. One of the essential elements in the pathophysiology of development of GH is the wide fluctuation in both glucose and insulin levels. GH and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are clinically indistinguishable, and latter is more prevalent in diabetic patients and can progress to advanced liver disease and cirrhosis. Gradient dual-echo MRI can distinguish GH from NAFLD; however, GH can reliably be diagnosed only by liver biopsy. Adequate glycemic control can result in complete remission of clinical, laboratory and histological abnormalities. There has been a recent report of varying degree of liver fibrosis identified in patients with GH. Future studies are required to understand the biochemical defects underlying GH, noninvasive, rapid diagnostic tests for GH, and to assess the consequence of the fibrosis identified as severe fibrosis may progress to cirrhosis. Awareness of this entity in the medical community including specialists is low. Here we briefly reviewed the English literature on pathogenesis involved, recent progress in the evaluation, differential diagnosis, and management."

A 75-year-old woman with untreated diabetes mellitus presented with difficulty in moving and anorexia. Laboratory studies revealed inflammation, a urinary infection, and diabetic ketoacidosis. Klebsiella pneumoniae was detected in both urine and blood cultures. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed emphysematous lesions in the paravertebral soft tissue, spinal canal, and iliopsoas muscle, with intraosseous gas at L1 and L2. These findings led to a diagnosis of emphysematous osteomyelitis. We herein review 35 reported cases of emphysematous osteomyelitis including our case."
