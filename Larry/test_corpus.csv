Where there are no randomized controlled trials or specific U.S. FDA labeling for issues in clinical practice, the participating clinical experts utilized their judgment and experience. Every effort was made to achieve consensus among the committee members. Position statements are meant to provide guidance, but they are not to be considered prescriptive for any individual patient and cannot replace the judgment of a clinician.

1,29545258,"BACKGROUND: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown an advantage of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) over multiple daily injections (MDI) in the general type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) population. RCT data on T1DM management in pregnancy remain limited. OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review of both RCTs and non-RCTs evaluating CSII versus MDI in T1DM-complicated pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: Electronic databases were searched for studies comparing CSII with MDI in T1DM-complicated pregnancy. METHODS: A meta-analysis provided point estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Continuous outcomes were reported as weighted mean differences (WMD) or standardized mean differences (SMD), and dichotomous data as relative risk (RR). RESULTS: The search identified 47 studies, including 43 non-RCTs, reporting on 7824 pregnancies. The meta-analysis showed a lower HbA1c level with CSII versus MDI in the first trimester (WMD -0.45%; 95%CI -0.62, -0.27). This difference decreased in subsequent trimesters. Compared to MDI, therapy with CSII resulted in higher gestational weight gain (GWG) (WMD 1.02 kg; 95%CI 0.41, 1.62), and lower daily insulin dose requirements in the first (SMD -0.46; 95%CI -0.68, -0.24) and subsequent trimesters. Moreover, infants from the CSII group were more likely to be large-for-gestational-age (LGA) (RR 1.16; 95%CI 1.07, 1.24) and less likely to be small-for-gestational-age (SGA) (RR 0.66; 95%CI 0.45; 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: In T1DM-complicated pregnancy, CSII compared to MDI therapy resulted in better first trimester glycaemic control; this difference decreased in subsequent trimesters. CSII therapy was associated with lower insulin requirements, higher GWG, and altered risk for infants being LGA and SGA."

Diabetic ketoacidosis may be precipitated by the catabolic stress of acute illness such as trauma, surgery, or infections. Recent studies have suggested that sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors precipitate DKA in Type 2 diabetes. We present a case series of four patients on SGLT-2 inhibitors who presented with DKA. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed and patients who were admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis in the last one year at our institute were identified. The charts of such patients were reviewed and we were able to identify 4 patients who were admitted with DKA and were on SGLT-2 inhibitors at the time of admission for the management of their diabetes. RESULTS: The age group of the four patients was between 45-65 years. Interestingly all four patients were female. The admission blood glucose levels of these patients ranged from 203 to 400(mg/dl). The pH at the time of admission was in the acidotic range with anion gap ranging from 19 to 24. Two of these four patients had symptoms of a localized infection at the time of admission, which was confirmed by laboratory and radiological evaluation. Three of these patients required management in the intensive care unit. CONCLUSION: Ketoacidosis is a rare but serious side effect of SGLT2 inhibitors. It is being increasingly reported as these drugs are now commonly being prescribed in the primary care setting. Awareness that DKA can occur in the setting of relative euglycemia is critical to recognize this life-threatening complication of diabetes. More research is needed to better understand the underlying pathophysiology and precipitating factors leading to ketoacidosis in SGLT-2 inhibitor treated patients."
